<p class="chaptitle">OFF THE CHILIAN COAST.</p>


<p>"Great spark plugs!"</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!"</p>

<p>"Py shiminy Grismus!"</p>

<p>There were three surprised and excited boys on the
rounded deck of the submarine boat <i>Grampus</i>. It was
a calm, cloudless night, and the sea was as smooth as
a mill pond; but, for all that, the night was cloudless, a
dank, clinging fog had rolled down from the Andes and
out upon the ocean, blotting out moon and star and
rendering their surroundings as black as Erebus.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> was proceeding slowly northward along
the Chilian coast. Motor Matt, Dick Ferral, and Carl
Pretzel were on the deck forward, keeping a sharp
lookout. The electric projector from the conning tower
bored a gleaming hole into the darkness ahead, giving
the lads a limited view in that direction. Speake was
half in and half out of the conning tower, steering from
that position.</p>

<p>The waters gurgled and lapped at the rounded sides
of the boat, then floated rearward in long lines of
phosphorescence, spreading out in the wake like two
sticks of an open fan. At the stern of the submarine
the propeller churned up a glittering froth.</p>

<p>What the boys saw, however, that had aroused their
startled exclamations was a cluster as of glowing lights
a foot or two under the surface of the water. This
mysterious glow was moving, at a moderate rate of
speed, in a course that crossed that of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>"Slow down, Speake!" called Matt to the helmsman.</p>

<p>The jingle of a bell, down in the motor room, was
heard faintly, and the submarine's speed fell off perceptibly.
The cluster of starlike points bubbled onward,
missed the bow of the <i>Grampus</i> by a few feet, and
vanished in the gloom on the port side.</p>

<p>"Vat it iss?" murmured Carl, rubbing a hand dazedly
across his eyes. "Dere iss lighdning pugs on der land,
und I vonder iss dere lighdning pug fishes in der sea?
Dot looked schust like a shark mit some search lights on
his headt."</p>

<p>"I'm a Fiji if there was any fish about that," averred
the bewildered Dick. "Can you rise to it, matey?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
asked, turning to Matt. "What sort of a sizing do you
give it?"</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys was puzzled.</p>

<p>"It might be a piece of drift from the shore," he
answered, "or the fragment of a wreck."</p>

<p>"Aber it <i>moofed</i>!" exclaimed Carl. "It moofed droo
der vater schust like it vas alife!"</p>

<p>"The current may have caused that. There are all
kinds of currents in this part of the ocean."</p>

<p>"Und der lights, Matt. Pieces oof wreck don'd haf
lights like dot!"</p>

<p>"That was a trick of the phosphorescence. There
were probably nails or spikes in the timber, and wherever
they projected and caused a ripple there was a
glow in the water."</p>

<p>Matt turned to Speake.</p>

<p>"Make a turn to the left, Speake," said he. The submarine
swerved slowly to the port tack. "There," said
Matt; "hold her so."</p>

<p>Dick gave a low laugh.</p>

<p>"You don't take much stock in that explanation of
yours, matey," he remarked, "or you wouldn't be following
that bit of supposed flotsam and jetsam."</p>

<p>"I've explained it in the only way I know how, Dick,"
returned Matt, "but I'm still a good deal in doubt. We'll
see if we can overhaul the thing and make a further
examination. I don't like to take the time, but it may
turn out to be time well spent."</p>

<p>Motor Matt knelt well forward, just where the V-shaped
waves parted over the sharp nose of the <i>Grampus</i>,
and while he knelt he peered fixedly into the water
ahead.</p>

<p>"You're such a cautious chap," spoke up Dick, hanging
to one of the flagstaff guys and likewise staring
ahead, "that I've been all ahoo wondering why you
were doing this night cruising. The night's as black
as a pocket, and this coast is about as dangerous as
you can find anywhere, and yet here we are, groping our
way along, never knowing what minute we may bounce
upon a reef or say how do you do to a sharp rock."</p>

<p>"Remember that Pacific Mail boat we spoke yesterday?"
inquired Matt, over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The one that told us they had news, in Santiago,
that a Japanese boat had got away from the Chilian,
Captain Sandoval, below the Strait of Magellan?" responded
Dick.</p>

<p>"Exactly. When we left English Reach, at the western
end of the strait, we know Captain Sandoval, of
the Chilian warship <i>Salvadore</i>, was pursuing the mysterious
Japanese steamer; and we also know that that
steamer had on board our enemies, the Sons of the Rising
Sun. The mail boat said the news that the steamer
had escaped the <i>Salvadore</i> had been flashed by wireless
from Punta Arenas, and had been repeated by telegraph
to Santiago and Valparaiso."</p>

<p>"I don'd pelieve dot Chap poat efer got avay from
der <i>Salvatore</i>!" declared Carl.</p>

<p>"It may be that she did, Carl," went on Matt, "and
we've got to make sure of it just as soon as we possibly
can. That's the reason we're traveling through this
thick fog, and taking our chances on hitting a reef or
sunken rock. We've got to reach Lota and find out
for sure if those Japs are again free to bother us. You
know what it means if the Sons of the Rising Sun got
away from Sandoval. Those misguided Japs have sworn
that the <i>Grampus</i> shall never be turned over to the
United States Government at Mare Island Navy Yard.
They're a desperate and fanatical lot, and we've got
to know just what we're up against, so far as they are
concerned. Lota is on the railroad and telegraph line,
and we'll get news there, if anywhere."</p>

<p>"As usual," observed Dick, "that head of yours has
been working, old ship, while the rest of us have been
wondering what you were trying to do. I don't think
you'll catch up with that piece of drift."</p>

<p>"Nor I," Matt answered, getting to his feet and coming
aft. "Whatever that was, I suspect we'll never be
able to discover, so my guess will have to stand. Put
her on the starboard tack, Speake," he added to the man
in the conning tower.</p>

<p>The submarine once more resumed her course toward
Arauco Bay and Lota.</p>

<p>"You fellows go below and turn in," Matt went on to
Dick and Carl. "I can con the ship, all right, and there's
no need of the two of you staying awake and helping
me on the lookout."</p>

<p>"You'd better let Glennie relieve you, mate," suggested
Dick. "You've been on deck duty for six hours."</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay right here," said Matt, "until we
get safely into Arauco Bay."</p>

<p>There was no use arguing with Motor Matt when he
made up his mind that duty commanded him to do a
certain thing, and Dick and Carl wished him luck and
went below.</p>

<p>Ensign Glennie was lying on the locker in the periscope
room.</p>

<p>"You shifted the course," said he, rising on one elbow
and peering at Dick and Carl as they dropped off the
iron ladder. "What was up?"</p>

<p>"Somet'ing mit a shiny headt vent past us," replied
Carl, dropping down on a stool and beginning to draw
off his shoes.</p>

<p>"Something with a shiny head?" queried the nonplused
ensign.</p>

<p>"Yah, so. It vas a funny pitzness."</p>

<p>"What was it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"I'm by," answered Dick, shaking his head. "I've
seen a good many queer things afloat, but that was the
queerest. It was too dark to see much, though. Mayhap
if we'd had a little more light, we could have made a
closer examination and the mystery would have been
explained."</p>

<p>Thereupon he went into details, telling Glennie all
that he and Carl knew.</p>

<p>"Can you make anything out of it, Glennie?" Dick
finished.</p>

<p>"I'm over my head, like the rest of you," answered
the ensign. "Probably Matt hit it off pretty well when
he said it was a bit of water-logged drift, floating between
two waves, with spikes cutting the water and
throwing off gleams of phosphorescence. This part of
the Pacific is full of cross-currents. And it's a mighty
dangerous stretch of water, too, I'm telling you. Matt
is certainly anxious to reach Lota, or he'd never persist
in pushing through waters like these in such a fog."</p>

<p>"He's worrying again over those Sons of the Rising
Sun."</p>

<p>Dick pulled off one of his shoes and swung it reflectively
in his hand.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is possible that that Jap steamer got
away from Sandoval," said Glennie. "The officers on
that mail boat must have got it wrong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our old raggie is bound to find out just how much
truth there is in the yarn, anyhow," continued Dick.
"We're what you might call on the last leg of our cruise,
and the little old <i>Grampus</i> has covered the east coast of
two continents and is well up the west coast. We have
dodged trouble in pretty good shape, so far, and Matt
don't intend to let the Sons of the Rising Sun put us
down and out at this late stage of the game."</p>

<p>"The Japs can't put Motor Matt down and out,"
averred Glennie, with suppressed admiration. "He has
met them at every point, and has given them the worst
of it. They'll never be able to destroy the <i>Grampus</i>.
Mark what I say, my lads, Motor Matt is going to
'make good' with ground to spare, and chalk up another
victory for the motor boys."</p>

<p>Dick and Carl would have cheered this warm sentiment,
but before they had a chance to do so, a wild
yell came from Speake.</p>

<p>"Tumble up here, you fellows! Quick, now!"</p>

<p>Speake, as he spoke, crushed himself against the side
of the conning-tower hatch, in order to make room for
those in the periscope room to pass him and reach the
deck.</p>

<p>Startled by the words and wildly excited manner of
the helmsman, Dick, Carl, and Glennie lost not an instant
in rushing up the ladder and dropping over the
side of the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Where's Matt?" cried Dick.</p>

<p>"That's just what I want to know," answered Speake,
his consternation growing and a tremulous awe finding
its way into his voice. "He was on the deck a few
minutes ago, but he isn't here now. The last I saw of
him he went aft, around the conning tower. The next
thing I knew, when I turned and looked for him, he
wasn't aboard."</p>

<p>All three of the lads were stricken dumb. For a brief
space none of them spoke, but looked toward each other
in the gloom, frantically alarmed and vaguely fearing&mdash;they
knew not what.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have fallen overboard," spoke up Glennie,
first to break the silence that held them as by an
uncanny spell, "and yet it's certain he's not on the boat."</p>

<p>"Matt!" roared Dick, making a trumpet of his hands
and calling into the blank darkness. "Ahoy, Matt!"</p>

<p>No answer was returned. All that could be heard
was the hum of the submarine's motor, the swish of the
propeller, and the lap and gurgle of waves along the
rounded side.</p>

<p>Carl began to whimper.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber! Oof anyt'ing has habbened py dot
bard oof mine, I don'd know vat I shall do, py shinks!
He vas der pest friendt vat I efer hat, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put about, Speake!" cried Dick, now thoroughly
alive to the situation. "If Matt went overboard, then
we're rushing away from him, and he's swimming
somewhere in our wake."</p>

<p>The shaken helmsman immediately turned the <i>Grampus</i>
in a wide circle and rang for full speed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HURLED INTO THE SEA.</p>


<p>Matt was very much worried when Dick and Carl,
agreeably to their orders, went below. It was not the
strange visitor that had passed the bows of the <i>Grampus</i>
on its glowing way that rested heavily on his mind, but
the news gathered from the captain of the mail boat
that had been spoken early in the day.</p>

<p>On leaving the western end of the Strait of Magellan,
the submarine and her crew had, as they supposed, left
behind them for the rest of their cruise their wily enemies,
the Sons of the Rising Sun. They had had trouble
enough on account of the Japanese while coming through
the strait, and Matt thought that he and his friends
were entitled to a respite, so far as the nefarious plots
of the fanatical young Japs were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The adventures of the motor boys, in and around Magellan
Strait, were set forth in No. 19 of the <span class="smcap">Motor Stories</span>, entitled,
"Motor Matt's Defiance; or, Around the Horn."</p></div>

<p>It was the responsibility for the safety of the <i>Grampus</i>
that rested so heavily on the young motorist's mind.
Weeks before, when the submarine had left Belize, British
Honduras, Captain Nemo, Jr., the owner of the boat,
had placed the craft entirely in Matt's hands.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust the <i>Grampus</i> with any one else,
Matt," declared the captain. "But you've got nerve,
your judgment is good, you know the craft from one
end to the other, and whenever anything goes wrong
and you get into a scrape, you've got a knack of always
getting out of it without much damage to yourself. A
hundred thousand dollars is to be paid for the <i>Grampus</i>
when she reaches Mare Island. If the submarine doesn't
reach there in good condition, the money will not be paid.
Sickness will detain me for a while in Belize, and so
that puts this work of taking the boat around the Horn
up to you. Now go ahead!"</p>

<p>Motor Matt appreciated to the full Captain Nemo,
Jr.'s trust and confidence. He had vowed to himself
over and over again that he would prove to the captain
he was worthy of the trust reposed in him. Matt was
thinking of all this on the deck of the <i>Grampus</i>, after
Dick and Carl had left him; and, in the midst of his
reflection, he fancied he heard a muffled sound from
somewhere in the submarine's wake.</p>

<p>Instantly alarmed, he passed the conning tower, without
exchanging any words with Speake, and took up a
position not far from the churning propeller. But he
heard nothing further, and could see nothing either to
increase or diminish his fears. He was just turning
about to make his way forward, when a coil struck about
his throat, drawing taut on the instant and preventing
any outcry. At the same instant there came an irresistible
pull backward.</p>

<p>Matt, astounded by this unexpected attack, reaching
him from some point away from the boat and darting
silently and suddenly out of the thick gloom, flung up
his hands in an attempt to clutch one of the wire guys of
the periscope mast.</p>

<p>He missed the guy by a fraction of an inch, slipped
downward over the rounded deck and rolled into the
water. He made little noise, so little that Speake could
not hear it above the swirl of waves thrown up by the
rounded plates of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>Another moment and Matt was in the water and
swimming. The deadly compression at his throat continued,
and he was unable to voice a sound. He could
see the little search light of the submarine moving rapidly
onward into the darkness, and could see the half
of Speake's form, like a blot of shadow, rearing out
of the tower hatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time Matt felt the pull of the rope about his
neck, drawing him steadily and remorselessly away into
the foggy night. No one spoke behind him, and there
was not the slightest sound to tell him who his captors
were, or where they were, or how they had succeeded
in making him a victim in that mysterious fashion.</p>

<p>A minute, two minutes, passed. At the end of that
time Matt felt his strength leaving him because of the
strangling grip about his throat. Then, suddenly, the
rearward "pull" relaxed and the constriction at his throat
ceased. With one hand he reached upward and pulled
the strangling coil loose and gulped down a deep draught
of air.</p>

<p>A moment later he gave vent to a cry, hoping to
attract the attention of Speake. But the <i>Grampus</i> was
too far away. With difficulty Matt freed himself of his
shoes and coat. He had no idea how long he would
have to swim, but he prepared himself to keep afloat as
long as possible. What the end was to be he did not
know, and he had no time to give to that phase of the
question.</p>

<p>Some mysterious force had hurled him from the deck
of the <i>Grampus</i> into the sea, and perhaps this same force
would continue to take care of him. Turning about in
the water, he lifted himself high with a downward stroke
of his powerful arms, and peered in the direction from
which the attack had come. He could see nothing and
could hear nothing.</p>

<p>For a moment Motor Matt was tempted to forget his
dire plight in marveling over the mysterious nature of
that attack. The next instant, however, he began asking
himself if it would be possible to reach the Chilian
shore. It was a mile away, at least. To swim such a
distance was no very extraordinary feat, but there were
currents sucking Matt oceanward, and against these it
was powerless for him to struggle.</p>

<p>Matt could keep afloat, but to what purpose? Would
it be possible for him to keep on the surface until his
friends on the submarine discovered his absence and
put back to his rescue? Even if he could swim for
that length of time, could his friends find him in that
darkness, with the current dragging him farther and
farther from the course over which the <i>Grampus</i> had
recently passed?</p>

<p>In Motor Matt's place, a good many lads would have
given up the struggle, but Matt was of different calibre.
As long as there was a breath in his body he would
fight, for he knew that while there is life there is always
hope.</p>

<p>Blindly and doggedly he continued his battle with the
waves, peering into the northeast from time to time, in
the hope of seeing the search light of the <i>Grampus</i>. He
did not see the search light, but he saw something else
lying sluggishly in the water not a great distance from
where he was.</p>

<p>"A log!" he thought.</p>

<p>Under the impression that fate had thrown across his
path a bit of drift from the mainland, he swam to the
object and laid hold of it as it heaved and ducked on
the placid waves.</p>

<p>It was not a log. As he put out one hand it came in
contact with smooth, wet metal. The object was a long
cylinder, blunt at one end and pointed at the other.</p>

<p>"A torpedo!" ran his thought, as he hung over the
rounded object with one arm and supported himself in
the water. "Who fired the torpedo?" was the question
he asked himself.</p>

<p>He had leisure now for a little reflection. No strength
was required to keep himself afloat, for the steel cylinder
supported him.</p>

<p>As he hung there, lifting and falling with the long,
deadly tube, his thoughts harked back to the queer
object he, and Dick, and Carl had seen in the water.
The result of his reflections paralyzed him.</p>

<p><i>Some mysterious enemy had launched the torpedo at
the Grampus!</i></p>

<p>Had the infernal machine struck the submarine, the
craft and every one aboard would have been torn to
pieces.</p>

<p>A slow horror pulsed through Motor Matt's veins.</p>

<p>The same enemies who had launched the torpedo must
surely have jerked Matt from the deck of the submarine.
But who were they? where were they?</p>

<p>With difficulty he lifted himself and got astride the
rolling cylinder. From that elevated position he looked
around him into the darkness. Silence reigned in every
direction. There was no sign of the mysterious foes
who had attempted to destroy the <i>Grampus</i> and to make
a prisoner of her commanding officer.</p>

<p>Presently the young motorist became conscious that
the coil was still about his throat, and that a long object
was trailing downward and hanging with some weight
from his neck.</p>

<p>It was a rope. He began pulling it in, coiling the wet
length of it in his hand. The rope was all of seventy-five
feet long, he judged, and that distance must have
marked the position of his foes when the noose was
cast. To see even half that distance into the thick
darkness was impossible, but why had Matt not been
able to <i>hear</i> the men who had attempted such dastardly
work?</p>

<p>Speculations were useless. Matt, however, had secured
a makeshift raft which would keep him afloat until
such time as the <i>Grampus</i>, or some other boat, could
pick him up.</p>

<p>Hoping that the submarine would come to no harm,
and determined to make the best of his desperate situation,
the king of the motor boys set about making an
examination of the steel tube that supported him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SAVED BY A TORPEDO.</p>


<p>Matt's first move was to take the noose from about
his throat and pass the rope around and around the
torpedo, tying it fast. The loops of the rope gave him
a handhold which he could not possibly have secured
otherwise on the hard, smooth shell, rendered slippery
by the water with which it was drenched.</p>

<p>The torpedo, he quickly discovered, was a Whitehead&mdash;a
powerful and deadly engine in use by all the navies
of the world.</p>

<p>It was about seventeen feet long and a foot and a
half in diameter. Torpedoes of this nature are constructed
to run under the surface at any required depth
down to twenty feet. A propeller and compressed air
furnishes the motive power, and as the air becomes exhausted,
the torpedo rises higher and higher. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
air shut off and engine stopped, the cylinder rises to
the surface. As that was the case in the present instance,
it seemed certain that the motive power of this
particular torpedo had been nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i>, being constructed for work in time of
war, had torpedo tubes and one torpedo aboard. Matt
had studied the mechanism of the Whitehead, and he
was able to proceed intelligently in his present dilemma.
If there was still any air in the big tube, he might use
it to carry him to the north and east, in the direction
taken by the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>The lever, he discovered, which locked the engine was
standing erect, while the "tripper," which worked automatically
the instant the torpedo was discharged and
put it under its own power, was lying flat on the curved
side.</p>

<p>Before trying to get the compressed air in the shell
to working, he swam to the blunt end of the torpedo and
removed the small propeller that manipulated the firing
pin. By this wise move he rendered harmless the explosive
within the shell.</p>

<p>Swimming back, he mounted his queer raft by means
of the rope loops, lifted the "tripper," and depressed the
starting lever.</p>

<p>The twin screws, placed tandem fashion at the stern,
began slowly to revolve. Heading the point of the tube
north by east, he began one of the strangest rides that
had ever fallen to his lot.</p>

<p>As the air within became more and more depleted,
the steel cylinder rose higher and higher in the water.</p>

<p>For a lad so deeply in love with motors as was Matt,
the novelty of that ride could not fail to appeal to him.
He was safe, at least for a time, and felt sure that
ultimately he would gain the shore or be picked up by
a coastwise ship. As for the <i>Grampus</i>, there were cool
heads and steady nerves aboard of her, and the submarine's
safety would be looked after. Besides, the
mysterious foes had failed in their night's work, and
there was probably no more danger to be apprehended
from them.</p>

<p>As Matt held himself astride his queer craft, guiding
it by a pull this way and that, he fell to thinking of the
manner in which he had been hurled into the sea.</p>

<p>Some boat had discharged the torpedo, and it seemed
certain that those who had tossed the rope over his head
and pulled him from the submarine's deck had been on
the same boat.</p>

<p>Had it been the intention of Matt's enemies to haul
him aboard their boat, or only to strangle him and keep
him in the water until the <i>Grampus</i> got well away, then
cast him off and let him sink to the bottom?</p>

<p>Matt's humane instincts rebelled against the latter supposition.
His enemies, he reasoned, had intended hauling
him aboard their boat, but in some manner had lost
hold of the end of the line.</p>

<p>A Whitehead torpedo costs something like four thousand
dollars, and is altogether too valuable to leave
adrift when it has been fired and misses its target.
Those who had discharged the torpedo would surely
look for it&mdash;and, if they found it, they would also find
Matt.</p>

<p>This caused the young motorist a good deal of trepidation.
He reasoned, however, that on account of the
darkness of the night and the fog, his mysterious foes
would probably remain in the part of the ocean where
the torpedo had been fired and look for it in the daylight.
Between that hour and daylight, Matt was hoping
to be picked up.</p>

<p>The compressed air in a torpedo will carry it about
nine hundred yards. This torpedo had not gone its full
distance, on account of an automatic misplacement of
the "tripper" and starting lever, but enough of the air
had been used so that Matt's ride was a short one.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the propellers ceased to revolve,
and Matt and the steel cylinder came to a stop, heaving
up and down on the surface of the water. Yielding to
the pull of the current, the torpedo started erratically
seaward, and another fear was born in Matt's mind.</p>

<p>The farther seaward he was carried, the more difficult
it would be to fall in with a passing boat, and the
farther off would be his rescue. To carry his grewsome
thoughts still farther, there was a good chance
that he would succumb to thirst and hunger before his
woeful plight was discovered, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But this gloomy train of reflections was interrupted.
In the distance Matt could see a glow of light, shining
hazily through the fog. Was it the search light of the
<i>Grampus</i>, or a gleam from the other boat?</p>

<p>Divided between hopes and doubts, he waited and
watched. The glow presently resolved itself into a pencil
of light, and he became fairly positive that it was the
searching eye of the submarine.</p>

<p>"Ahoy!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Instantly a distant commotion struck on his ears.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, ahoy!" came an excited answer. "Is that you,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Shift your wheel a couple of points to starboard
and you'll be heading straight for me. Come
slow&mdash;and don't run me down."</p>

<p>The gleam of light suddenly shifted its position. Aiming
directly at Matt, it grew brighter and brighter.
Matt was able to make out the dark outlines of the
submarine's low deck and conning tower, and to see
three figures well forward toward the bow, all clinging
to guys and leaning out over the water.</p>

<p>"Are you swimming, old ship?" came the tense voice
of Dick Ferral.</p>

<p>"Hardly," Matt answered. "I've been in the water
for upward of an hour&mdash;and I couldn't have fought the
current that long if I had been compelled to swim."</p>

<p>"How you vas keeping off der pottom, Matt?" piped
up the relieved voice of Carl.</p>

<p>"There's a sort of a raft under me," Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"A raft? Where the dickens did you get hold of a
raft, Matt?"</p>

<p>This was Glennie.</p>

<p>"Not exactly a raft," went on Matt, "but a Whitehead
torpedo. We met each other at just the right
time for me. I'm riding the torpedo, and it's a fine
thing for keeping a fellow afloat."</p>

<p>Startled expressions came from those on the submarine.
By then the Grampus was so close that her
search light had Matt and the Whitehead in full glare.
The amazement of the boys on the submarine increased.</p>

<p>"Dot's der plamedest t'ing vat I efer heardt oof!"
gasped Carl. "Modor Matt riding on a dorpeto schust
like it vas a tree, oder somet'ing like dot! Ach, himmelblitzen!"</p>

<p>Speake guided the <i>Grampus</i> alongside the torpedo.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Speake!" warned Glennie. "If that infernal
machine bunts into us, we're gone."</p>

<p>"I'm looking out for that," answered Speake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't need to worry," called Matt reassuringly.
"I wasn't going to take chances with two hundred
pounds of high explosive, and one of the first things I
did was to fix the priming pin so it wouldn't work."</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i>, responding to a signal flashed into the
motor room, came to a halt. Dick threw Matt a rope,
and he began tying it to one of the loops that encircled
the shell of the torpedo.</p>

<p>"Why are you making fast, matey?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"Because I want to tow this torpedo into Lota," answered
Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother that! Here we've been all ahoo thinking
you were at the bottom and as good as done for. Now
that we've found you again&mdash;and in a most amazing
way, at that&mdash;cut loose from that steel tube and come
aboard. What's the use of fussing with it?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain when I come aboard," Matt went on.
"Make the other end of the line fast, Dick, and give
the cable a scope of fifty feet. I've hooked to her so
that she will follow us stern foremost."</p>

<p>Glennie helped Dick make the cable fast; then Matt,
drawing in on the line, came alongside the rounded deck
plates, and Carl helped him off the torpedo.</p>

<p>"Ach, vat a habbiness!" sputtered Carl. "I hat gifen
you oop for deadt, Matt, und vat shouldt I efer have
done mitoudt my bard? How you come to be like dot,
hey?"</p>

<p>"There's something mighty mysterious about it," said
Matt. "I thought I heard a noise somewhere in the
darkness behind the <i>Grampus</i>, and stepped aft to watch
and listen; then, before I knew what was up, the noose
of a rope fell over my head and tightened about my
throat. I went into the water with hardly a splash, unable
to give a cry for help."</p>

<p>"I didn't hear a sound!" put in Speake excitedly.</p>

<p>"It was all done so quickly and silently, I don't see
how you could have known anything about it, Speake,"
said Matt. "I was in a bad way when I sighted that
torpedo. I got astride of it, started the propellers, and
rode in the direction the <i>Grampus</i> had taken. When
the compressed air gave out, I was expecting to be
picked up by some other boat&mdash;by the boat that had
fired the torpedo at us."</p>

<p>"At us!" exclaimed Glennie. "Do you mean to say
that torpedo that saved you was launched at the <i>Grampus</i>?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," returned Matt. "It was the torpedo Dick,
Carl, and I saw, and which I thought might be a floating
log or a piece of wreckage."</p>

<p>This astounding intelligence almost carried Matt's
chums off their feet.</p>

<p>"What enemies have we in these waters?" cried the
startled Glennie.</p>

<p>"Why," answered Matt, "who but the Sons of the
Rising Sun?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE.</p>


<p>"Let's go below, mates," suggested Dick, "and overhaul
all this. There's meat in it for us, and it will stand
us in hand to get at it."</p>

<p>"I'll not go below this night, Dick," said Matt, "and
we'd better all of us stay on deck and keep our eyes
peeled for Japs. Carl can go and bring me up some
dry clothes, an extra pair of shoes and stockings, and
an extra coat."</p>

<p>"Dot's me, bard," chirruped Carl, making for the
conning tower.</p>

<p>"Get the boat on her proper course, Speake," said
Matt; "we must get out of this neighborhood as soon
as we can&mdash;and as quick as we can. Watch the torpedo
as we come about, Dick, you and Glennie. See
that the cable doesn't foul the guys or the periscope
mast."</p>

<p>Speake signaled for a fresh start, and as the submarine
described a circle and pointed the other way,
Dick and Glennie kept the hawser clear. The torpedo
took its scope of cable, and the drag of it was plainly
felt as soon as the submarine began to pull.</p>

<p>"It's main lucky, mates," remarked Dick, as Carl
regained the deck with Matt's dry clothing, and the
young motorist began to get out of his wet togs, "that
we've such a smooth sea. If the wind was blowing
hard and the water was choppy, Matt would have a
hard time with that torpedo of his."</p>

<p>"A lucky thing, too," added Glennie, "that there's a
thick fog. If Matt's enemies had seen him, they'd have
finished the work they set out to do with that lariat."</p>

<p>"On the other hand, Glennie," put in Matt, "we don't
want to forget that it was the fog that enabled them to
come so close. Their boat must have got within seventy-five
feet of the <i>Grampus</i> in order for any one to
drop that noose over my head."</p>

<p>"I'll be keelhauled if I can understand how such a
trick was done," said Dick. "From my experiences on
the cattle ranges of Texas, I should say that a seventy-five-foot
cast with a riata is a mighty big one, and
liable to be successful about once in a hundred times.
But here's this swab that lassoed Matt, snaring him
the first crack&mdash;and throwing from a boat's deck and
across water, at that!"</p>

<p>"Then, too," proceeded Glennie, "their boat has less
noise to it than any craft I ever heard of. It shoved
along within seventy-five feet of us&mdash;and none of us
heard a sound!"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a noise, Glennie," returned Matt,
"and that was what took me aft."</p>

<p>"I can't understand how it was done," muttered the
ensign.</p>

<p>"Veil, anyvays," struck in Carl, "id vas done, no
madder vedder anypody oondershtands it or nod. Kevit
making some guesses aboudt der vay it vas pulled off
und look der pitzness skevare in der face. It vas der
Chaps&mdash;who else vould dry to plow der <i>Grampus</i> oudt
oof water? So vat's to be done aboudt it?"</p>

<p>"Carl's talking sense, fellows," said Matt. "Those
Japs are against us. We thought we had left them
behind, and that we should be able to reach San Francisco
before they could make us any trouble, but here
they are, going for us harder than ever."</p>

<p>"They're not using that steamer of theirs, mates,"
averred Dick.</p>

<p>"The steamer might have torpedo tubes," answered
Glennie.</p>

<p>"Ay, so she might; but she couldn't lie along within
seventy-five feet of us without making noise enough to
wake the dead. The Sons of the Rising Sun have
changed boats&mdash;and how have they had time to do that,
and reach this part of the coast almost at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
as ourselves? We've plugged right along ever since leaving
the strait."</p>

<p>"That gives me an idea," said the ensign, "and you
fellows can take it for what it's worth. Our knowledge
of the Sons of the Rising Sun is a trifle hazy, but we
know them to be a secret organization whose aim is to
help Japan. The organization is not sanctioned by the
Japanese government, for its members commit deeds
which would plunge the nation into war if it sanctioned
them. Now, this secret society is probably quite extensive.
Perhaps we are not dealing with the branch
of it that kept us busy most of the way to the Horn,
but with another outfit of the Sons of the Rising Sun
that has been laying for us here."</p>

<p>"That's possible," agreed Matt. "The question is,
shall we put into Lota and try to find out something
more regarding our enemies, or keep on to Valparaiso,
as we had originally intended?"</p>

<p>"I'm for putting in at Lota," said Dick. "We can't
tow that infernal Whitehead all the way to Valparaiso."</p>

<p>"It will be just as well to stop there, in my opinion,"
seconded Glennie. "If we're dealing with another branch
of the Sons of the Rising Sun, perhaps we can get some
information about them in Lota."</p>

<p>"Meppy," ventured Carl, "ve could lay in a sooply
oof gasoline in Lota, und vouldn't haf to shdop at Valparaiso,
huh? Dot vould safe dime, und I am gedding
hungry for a look at der Unidet Shtates again. Der
more I see of odder gountries, der more vat I like my
own."</p>

<p>"His own!" laughed Dick, who, now that Motor Matt
had been safely recovered, was feeling in fine fettle.
"You could tell he was a Yank, just by the way he
talks, eh?"</p>

<p>"I peen an American mit a Dutch agsent," protested
Carl, "und I t'ink so mooch oof der Shdars und Shdripes
as anypody. I vould schust as soon shtep on der Pritish
lion's tail as anyt'ing vat I know."</p>

<p>"If you step on the British lion's tail, and I find it
out, matey," laughed Dick, "I'll have you hauled up
and fined for cruelty to animals. One of these days
I'm going to write to the kaiser and tell him about
you."</p>

<p>"Vat I care for der kaiser?" snorted Carl. "He iss
a pooty goot feller, aber he ain'd so big like der Bresident
oof der land oof der free und der home oof Modor
Matt."</p>

<p>"Fine-o!" chuckled Dick.</p>

<p>"A dandy sentiment, Carl!" exclaimed Glennie. "What
do you think of that, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Why," returned Matt, "I think that if the lot of us
don't stop joshing and attend more to watching our
immediate neighborhood that the land of the free and
the home of the brave is liable to be minus one submarine
and a lot of motor boys. That Jap boat is a
particularly noiseless craft; she came close enough to
us to launch a torpedo, and close enough to tangle me
up in a rope and pull me into the ocean. If she did it
once, she can do it again. We've got to keep sharp
eyes forward, aft, and on both sides. Dick, you'll be
the bow lookout, and Glennie can go aft; you watch
the port side, Carl, and I'll watch the starboard. Can
you steer for the rest of the night, Speake?" he added
to the man in the conning tower.</p>

<p>"I guess I can stand this extra duty if you can, Matt,"
replied Speake, "considering what you've been through."</p>

<p>"A dip in the ocean and a ride on a torpedo doesn't
count," said Matt, dropping his wet clothes down the
hatch; "it's what may happen to us if we don't keep
on our guard that bothers me. This boat is going to be
delivered at Mare Island, Japs or no Japs."</p>

<p>"Und righdt site oop mit care, you bed you!" cried
Carl, dropping down on the port side of the conning
tower. "I feel so easy in my mindt as oof I vas alretty
pack in der best gountry vat efer vas."</p>

<p>"Carl is full of patriotism to-night, mates," observed
Dick, from the bow.</p>

<p>"I vas dickled pecause Matt is alife und kicking. Dot
inshpires me mit batriotic sendiment, und odder feelings
oof choy. Be jeerful, eferypody."</p>

<p>Weighing the evidence offered by the torpedo attack,
and the snaring and dragging of Matt into the water,
had not resulted in bringing out very much that was
of importance. It served, however, to emphasize the
need of vigilance by developing the resourcefulness and
malevolence of a wily foe.</p>

<p>At 4 a. m. the submarine was close to the land lying
south of the Bay of Lota, and, as the mist was
still too thick to make out the distance and bearing of
the coast, Matt thought it advisable to stop the motor
and wait for the fog to clear with the sun.</p>

<p>Advantage was taken of this stop to prepare breakfast.
While all hands were eating, Gaines and Clackett, who
had been at their posts during the exciting occurrences
of the night, were duly informed of all that had taken
place.</p>

<p>At 6 a. m. the morning was bright enough so that
Matt felt they could proceed with safety.</p>

<p>The passage into the Bay of Lota, between the island
of Santa Maria and Lavapié Point, is narrow and difficult,
abounding with sunken rocks and other hidden
dangers that have not been surveyed and charted.</p>

<p>Luck, however, was with the motor boys, and the
passage into the bay was succesfully accomplished. Just
as the sun broke through the mist and brought out the
beauties of the bay, the <i>Grampus</i> nosed her way into it.</p>

<p>On three sides the bay is surrounded by wooded hills,
which shelter it in every direction except on the north.</p>

<p>"Dowse me," muttered Dick; "this coast looks like
that of Cornwall and Devonshire, with that red earth,
those granite cliffs, and the trees running down to the
water's edge. What are those chimneys and all that
smoke over there?"</p>

<p>"Smelting works and potteries," explained Glennie.
"They are owned by a woman, Madam Cousiño, one
of the richest women in Chili."</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i>, being of light draught, was able to go
close inshore. Anchor was dropped within a couple of
cables' length of the wharf. The "mud hooks" had
hardly taken hold before a man in a tawdry blue uniform
came off from the shore in a boat. He was rowed
by two negroes, and appeared to be very much excited.</p>

<p>When his boat was laid alongside, the official stood
up, flourished his arms, and spouted a stream of language.
It was Spanish, and came in such a torrent
that Matt, who knew something of the lingo, could
make nothing of it. Glennie was better versed in the
tongue, and listened attentively and with growing concern.</p>

<p>"Here's a go, Matt!" exclaimed the ensign, as soon as
the official paused to catch his breath. "This man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the captain of the port, and he has placed us all under
arrest."</p>

<p>"Arrest?" cried Matt incredulously. "What for?"</p>

<p>"He says we're thieves, and that we have stolen this
submarine boat."</p>

<p>"Dot's aboudt der lasht t'ing vat I oxpected!" muttered
Carl. "Take der uniform off dot feller, und ve
vill find he iss a Son oof der Rising Sun, I bed you.

<p class="chaptitle">A SURPRISING SITUATION.</p>


<p>"Sink me!" growled Dick. "Here's a rum go, if anybody
asks you. It's bobs to sovereigns that those Japs
are mixed up in this."</p>

<p>"We can very soon convince the captain of the port
that he's made a mistake," said Matt quietly. "Get your
written instructions, Glennie, and we'll go ashore with
him. There's something queer about this, and it may
be a good thing for us to get to the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"How aboudt Tick und me?" inquired Carl. "Ain'd
ve going along mit you?"</p>

<p>"You and Dick and the rest of the crew," Matt answered,
"will stay here and take care of the <i>Grampus</i>.
Somebody will have to do that, you know, Carl. It's
fully as important as going ashore and explaining matters
to the officials."</p>

<p>Glennie told the captain of the port that he and Matt
would go ashore with him and make it plain to everybody
that there was a mistake. The ensign's uniform,
spick and span and mighty fetching, made a wholesome
impression upon the captain of the port.</p>

<p>While Glennie was getting his papers, the port official
dropped back alongside the torpedo and examined it
with considerable interest. When the ensign reappeared
on the submarine's deck, the boat was brought back and
Matt and Glennie got aboard. In five minutes they had
reached the wharf and clambered ashore.</p>

<p>The negroes who had rowed the boat dropped in on
each side of the two young Americans, each drawing
an old-fashioned pistol that fired with a percussion cap.</p>

<p>"They're bound we're not going to run," laughed
Matt.</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Glennie, "but I'd rather be
in front of those old relics when they're shot off than
behind them. I guess a fellow would be safer."</p>

<p>The captain of the port led the way to the Casa de la
Administracion of the Señora Cousiño. It was built on
the crest of a low rise, and afforded a fine view of the
bay. A tall, slim man, who looked like a Frenchman,
stood on the steps of the casa surveying the <i>Grampus</i>
through a glass. With an expression of disappointment,
he lowered the glass and turned toward the captain of
the port as he drew near. Then there was French talk
and Spanish talk&mdash;the tall, slim man using his native
tongue, which the Chilian evidently understood, and the
Chilian using the Spanish, with which the Frenchman
appeared familiar.</p>

<p>Glennie gave strict attention to all that was going
on. The finger and whole-arm movements, the hunching
of the shoulders, and the shaking and ducking of
the heads, accompanied the talk as a sort of pantomime.
Matt was highly amused.</p>

<p>A look of astonishment appeared in Glennie's face as
he listened.</p>

<p>"By George!" the ensign exclaimed, when the conversation
between the Chilian and the Frenchman had
died down. "We've jumped into a surprising situation
here, Matt, if I've got this thing right."</p>

<p>"What is it, Glennie?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, the Frenchman says that the submarine isn't
the boat he thought it was, and that our arrest has been
a mistake."</p>

<p>"I'm glad they found that out without putting us to
any trouble. Is there another submarine in these waters?
And has it been stolen?"</p>

<p>"That's where the surprising part comes in. I'll have
to talk with these fellows, and ask them a few questions,
before I can get the layout clear in my mind."</p>

<p>French and Spanish had formed a part of Glennie's
education at Annapolis; he reeled off both languages
now, first at one and then at the other of the two men,
asking questions and receiving voluble replies.</p>

<p>In five minutes he had the situation straightened out
to his satisfaction, and sat down on one of the stone
steps beside Matt.</p>

<p>"The tall man, Matt," said Glennie, "is Captain Pons,
of Edouard Lavalle et Cie, shipbuilders, of Havre,
France. This firm of Lavalle &amp; Co. are builders of
submarines, and they recently finished such a craft for
the Chilian navy. The boat was brought over on a
tramp freighter, and Captain Pons came along to instruct
the Chilian officers and crew in the manner of
running the submarine, and also to secure a draft for
the purchase price.</p>

<p>"The submarine was unloaded safely, and was provisioned
by Captain Pons for a run to Santiago, where
she was to be inspected by the secretary of the navy.
Captain Pons was not to get his money from the government
until the submarine reached Santiago. The
Chilian crew was to come over from Coronel yesterday
afternoon, but arrived in the morning, a good twelve
hours ahead of time. Captain Pons rowed out with them
to the submarine, showed the captain of the crew all
over the boat and explained the machinery to him; then,
quite unexpectedly, so far as Captain Pons was concerned,
the crew grabbed the Frenchman, threw him into
the rowboat, closed the hatch of the submarine, and
dropped into the bottom of the bay."</p>

<p>Matt was listening with intense interest.</p>

<p>"The crew that Captain Pons took out to the submarine
wasn't the right one?" he observed.</p>

<p>"No. The real crew arrived in the afternoon, agreeably
to schedule, and found Captain Pons without a
submarine and very much up in the air. If he can't
recover the submarine from the thieves, his firm may
hold him responsible for the loss of the stolen boat."</p>

<p>"There were torpedoes in the French submarine?"</p>

<p>Matt began to grow excited as the situation cleared
before him.</p>

<p>"Two," replied Glennie.</p>

<p>"And the bogus crew&mdash;who were they?"</p>

<p>"Instead of coming from Coronel, it was discovered
that they came from the south&mdash;by railroad from Valdivia,
on the coast. It has also been discovered that
they were Japanese&mdash;Japs who had their eyes straightened.
It is supposed that they are from the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
steamer that escaped from Captain Sandoval, below
English Reach."</p>

<p>Matt's astonishment almost lifted him off the stone
step on which he was sitting.</p>

<p>"Our old enemies!" he exclaimed. "The Sons of the
Rising Sun have secured a submarine boat, and that
means that they can follow us wherever we go."</p>

<p>"Hard luck, Matt, that events should drift into this
tangle! That French submarine had to be here, it seems,
at just the right time to help out the Japs. The young
Samurai must have known about this other craft. After
dodging Captain Sandoval, they managed to reach Valdivia
and came on from there by train. That is how
they were able to get ahead of us."</p>

<p>"Every mysterious twist is taken out of the situation
now, Glennie," said Matt, almost stunned by the audacity
of the Japs and the marvelous way in which circumstances
had aided them. "They took possesion of the
French submarine and started south to meet the <i>Grampus</i>.
The noiseless way in which they hung upon our flanks
is easy to understand. The torpedo was launched at us
while the French boat was submerged; and when that
rope was hurled at me, the boat was just out of the
water&mdash;there were no lights about her, and the search
light of the <i>Grampus</i> enabled those on the French craft
to make that cast with the riata."</p>

<p>Matt's face went pale.</p>

<p>"Glennie," he continued, "the hardest job of our lives
is ahead of us! The Japs have a submarine, and there's
not one of them who would not willingly give his life if,
by doing so, he could destroy the <i>Grampus</i>. As long as
our enemies were in a steamboat, and compelled to remain
on the surface, it was easy to keep away from
them; but now, no matter where we go, they can follow
us."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about this French boat," returned
Glennie thoughtfully, "but I'll bet something
handsome she's not half so good a craft as the <i>Grampus</i>.
There's a big advantage for us, right at the start. Then,
again, about the only thing we're to fear from the stolen
submarine is the torpedo work. Captain Pons says there
were only two torpedoes in the craft. One of them is
accounted for. They have only one more&mdash;and I guess
we can get away from <i>that</i>. Besides all this, don't forget
that the Japs are green hands with the submarine,
and have had no practical experience in running her.
Captain Pons explained to them the theoretical part of
the machinery, but, you take it from me, those wily Orientals
are going to get themselves into trouble."</p>

<p>"They man&oelig;uvred the submarine pretty well last
night," said Matt. "I don't see how they could improve
much on their work. A Jap, Glennie, is a regular genius
in 'catching on' to things. Show him how to do a piece
of work once, and he knows it for all time. They're
clever&mdash;as clever as they are wily, and sometimes treacherous."</p>

<p>At this point, Captain Pons put in a few words.</p>

<p>"I see ze torpedo is wiz youar boat, monsieur. You
say zat you peek heem out of ze sea, but he is my torpedo,
and he is vorth many sousand francs. I am to
have him, eh?"</p>

<p>Matt looked at Glennie.</p>

<p>"We might need that torpedo, Matt," suggested the
ensign, "for the <i>Grampus</i> has only one. If it comes to a
fight with the French boat that extra Whitehead would
come in handy. I think we had better keep it."</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Matt. He turned to Captain Pons.
"The torpedo was fired at us, captain," he went on, "and
it was by a happenchance, and at a considerable risk to
myself, that I was able to save it and tow it in."</p>

<p>"He is mine, by gar!" cried the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"What good is the torpedo to you without the submarine?"</p>

<p>"Ma foi, I can sell heem. I save zat much."</p>

<p>"Any way you figure it," insisted Matt, "we're entitled
to salvage on the torpedo."</p>

<p>"Nozzing, not one centime!" screeched Captain Pons,
jumping up and down and flourishing his arms.</p>

<p>"Suppose I pay you the difference between the salvage
and the cost of the torpedo?" asked Matt, willing to adjust
the matter in any way that would secure peace.</p>

<p>"Non! I want ze torpedo, and zis talk of ze salvage
is w'at you call boosh; <i>oui</i>, zat is all, nozzing but boosh."</p>

<p>There seemed no amicable way of settling the dispute.
Matt, feeling that the Whitehead was of prime importance
to the <i>Grampus</i>, was determined to stick to his
contention.</p>

<p>He and Glennie stood up, and all on the steps of the
casa turned their eyes downward to where the <i>Grampus</i>
lay on the placid waters of the harbor, the long, black
cylinder of the Whitehead some forty or fifty feet back
of the stern.</p>

<p>While they looked, a most astounding thing happened.
The torpedo seemed suddenly to become imbued with
life. It shivered, jerked sidewise like an animated log,
whirled around frantically, and then, with one end
leaping into the air, it darted downward, out of sight!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER ATTACK.</p>


<p>This weird vanishing on the part of the object in dispute
between Motor Matt and Captain Pons left those
on steps of the Casa gasping. The Frenchman dropped
limply down and hugged his folded arms to his breast;
the Chilian looked wild, and a superstitious fear arose
in the eyes of the two negroes. Glennie grabbed up the
glasses the captain had been using a few minutes before,
clapped them to his eyes, and proceeded to examine
the surface of the bay.</p>

<p>The strange movements of the torpedo had had something
of an effect upon the <i>Grampus</i>, for she had swung
about on her cable and dipped slightly sternward. She
was lying quietly enough now, however, and Carl, Dick,
Speake, Gaines, and Clackett were swarming over her
deck and evidently wondering what had become of the
Whitehead.</p>

<p>Matt, with his naked eyes, could see his friends moving
about, although it was impossible for him to discover
exactly what they were doing.</p>

<p>"They're pulling in the rope that was made fast to
the torpedo," said Glennie. "They've got the end of it in
their hands."</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" murmured Matt dazedly. "That
was a queer performance, I must say. Can you see anything
of the Whitehead, Glennie?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. There must have been some compressed
air still left in the cylinder, and in some way it
got to the screws."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's not it, Glennie. Even if the Whitehead's
screws had begun to work they couldn't have caused the
big tube to dance around in that unheard-of fashion.
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt, with a sudden alarming thought running
through his mind, started down the steps at a run. The
Frenchman shouted something. Taking his cue from
Captain Pons, the Chilian also shouted. Probably it was
a command for Matt to halt, but the young motorist did
not construe it in that way. Pons, himself, had said that
there was no cause for the arrest of Matt and Glennie,
and Motor Matt believed that he was perfectly free to
go wherever he wished. Just then he was tremendously
eager to get aboard the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>One of the old-fashioned pistols went off with a <i>bang</i>
like a small cannon. A lead slug screeched through the
air well over Matt's head.</p>

<p>"Come back, Matt!" yelled Glennie. "If you don't,
the next bullet may come closer to you."</p>

<p>Matt faced about indignantly.</p>

<p>"What are they shooting at me for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"They don't want you to get away, just yet."</p>

<p>"But I've got to get away! We must get aboard the
<i>Grampus</i> as quick as the nation will let us. Can't you
understand this business, Glennie? That French submarine
is in the bottom of the bay! The Japs are recovering
that torpedo! You know why they want it,
as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" exclaimed Glennie, "I hadn't thought of
that. But you'd better come back here, Matt, while we
explain the situation to Captain Pons. It's better to have
him and the captain of the port for friends rather than
enemies."</p>

<p>"Every minute's delay makes the position of the
<i>Grampus</i> just that much more dangerous. Carl, Dick,
and the rest don't know a thing about this other submarine,
and if the Japs made an attack on our boat,
while she's lying at anchor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't fret about that, Matt," cut in Glennie. "The
Japs will have their hands full saving their torpedo.
They're thinking more about that Whitehead just at
present than of anything else. But, anyhow, we can't
try to dodge the bullets these negroes will send after us
if we make a run of it."</p>

<p>Matt, fretting over the delay, slowly returned to the
steps. The negro was reloading his pistol, the other was
making ready to use his weapon in case Matt refused to
obey orders, and both the captain of the port and Captain
Pons were looking extremely fierce and determined.</p>

<p>Both captains were talking to Glennie. The ensign
answered them sharply, and the captains gave responses
equally sharp.</p>

<p>"What a pair of dunderheads!" growled Glennie to
Matt.</p>

<p>"How's that?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Captain Pons has developed a very bright idea," was
the ensign's sarcastic response. "He says we caused the
torpedo to act in that unaccountable manner, and that we
did it in order to steal it from him."</p>

<p>Matt caught his breath.</p>

<p>"Is Captain Pons in his sober senses?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"All the senses Heaven endowed him with are on
duty."</p>

<p>"How does he think we could cause the torpedo to
act in that manner?"</p>

<p>"He lays it to our friends on the <i>Grampus</i>, but is
gloriously indefinite concerning the way they worked the
trick."</p>

<p>Matt walked up the steps and faced Captain Pons.
"We had nothing to do with the disappearance of the
torpedo!" he cried. "Why, the very idea is preposterous!
How could any of our men cause the Whitehead
to disappear in that fashion?"</p>

<p>"You want ze torpedo," insisted Captain Pons doggedly.
"You make ze dispute wiz me. Zen, w'en I say
<i>non</i>, ze torpedo belong wiz me, <i>pouf!</i> away he go lak a
streak. You haf stole heem, and you will answer to ze
French government for zat, by gar!"</p>

<p>"That is foolish talk, Captain Pons, for a man of your
age and experience."</p>

<p>"Hein! I am not so foolish as w'at you zink."</p>

<p>"It was the other boat that stole the torpedo&mdash;the submarine
the Japs stole from you."</p>

<p>"Zat could not be ze <i>Pom</i>. Ze Jap zey would not
dar-r-r-e bring ze <i>Pom</i> back in ze bay."</p>

<p>"You don't know those Japs as well as we do, captain.
They are enemies of ours, and have followed us
clear from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. They want to destroy
the <i>Grampus</i>, to keep her out of the hands of the
United States Navy. If I don't go down there, and
warn my friends and do something to protect our submarine,
this <i>Pom</i> of yours may make an attack."</p>

<p>"Zis is a friendly port," replied Captain Pons, with a
wave of the hand. "Ze Japs will not dar-r-r-e make
attack in ze friendly port."</p>

<p>Matt was disgusted. He felt that he had never met a
man so dense as this Captain Pons.</p>

<p>"The Japs stole your submarine in a friendly port,"
he remarked dryly. "I guess that proves that they're
not above committing lawless acts in a Chilian harbor.
You have no right to detain Ensign Glennie and myself.
We are under the protection of the Stars and
Stripes. If you are determined to keep us with you on
this ridiculous charge of stealing the torpedo, then will
you not accompany us to the <i>Grampus</i> while we take
measures for the boat's protection? While there, perhaps
we may be able to convince you how foolish this
charge of yours is."</p>

<p>"Zat is reasonable talk," admitted Captain Pons
gravely. "I vill spik wiz my good friend, Captain
Arco."</p>

<p>Matt and Glennie drew apart while the two captains
held a whispered conversation, although a very animated
one.</p>

<p>"A couple of jumping jacks!" muttered Glennie; "and
blockheads, to boot. I wonder what those French shipbuilders
were thinking of to send a man like Captain
Pons with their submarine."</p>

<p>"Well, he may know all about the submarine, and be
perfectly trustworthy," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust him to drive a pair of mules on a
canal."</p>

<p>The ensign was completely disgusted.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, a moment later. "The two great minds
have at last come to a decision in this momentous matter."</p>

<p>Captains Pons and Arco approached the two lads importantly.</p>

<p>"Ze good captain has agreed to go back wiz you and
me to ze submarine," announced Captain Pons. "If,
w'en we get zere, you will hand ovair ze torpedo, zen we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
not make ze trouble for you any more. <i>Allons!</i> let us
be gone."</p>

<p>The negroes, following an order from the captain of
the port, dropped in on either side of Matt and Glennie,
their antiquated pistols prominently displayed. Then,
with the two captains leading the way, the American lads
left the Casa de la Administracion.</p>

<p>"How those Japs managed to get hold of that torpedo
without showing themselves," remarked Glennie, on the
way to the landing, "is a conundrum."</p>

<p>"They must have come up under the torpedo," answered
Matt, "just close enough to the surface to grapple
a coil of the rope that was around the steel shell."</p>

<p>"Even on that theory the move is hard to understand.
While the <i>Pom</i> was under water it would not be possible
for any one aboard of her to work at the ropes
around the torpedo."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the grappling was done by man&oelig;uvring the
boat."</p>

<p>"That might be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Glennie was interrupted. By that time the party had
nearly reached the landing. Before any of them stepped
foot on the wharf, however, there came a loud detonation,
and a geyser-like column of water arose high in the
air. So lofty was the column that some of the spray
from it was hurled across the intervening stretch of the
bay and into the faces of Matt, Glennie, and the rest.</p>

<p>When the column had sunk downward, those on the
shore could see that the <i>Grampus</i> had disappeared!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BAD HALF HOUR.</p>


<p>Matt, Glennie, the two captains, and the negroes were
stupefied. They stood as though rooted to the ground
and stared across the water toward the spot where the
<i>Grampus</i> had been anchored.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacre!</i>" muttered Captain Pons. "Zat was a torpedo,
by gar!"</p>

<p>"It was fired at the <i>Grampus</i>!" cried Matt, almost beside
himself. "I was afraid an attack would be made&mdash;and
the boys didn't know anything about that other
submarine, Glennie. If our boat has been destroyed,
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt staggered against the post to which the painter
securing the rowboat was made fast.</p>

<p>The negroes began talking excitedly between themselves,
and Pons and Arco likewise began to air their
opinions.</p>

<p>"Don't lose your nerve, Matt," said Glennie. "That
was a torpedo, all right, and it goes without saying that
the Japs discharged it from the <i>Pom</i>, under water. It
hit something, and was discharged, <i>but it didn't hit the
Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"No," answered Matt, his moody eyes resting on the
spot where the <i>Grampus</i> had been anchored, "the torpedo
didn't hit the <i>Grampus</i>, for the column of water
spouted up almost a fathom from the place where she
was moored; but the boat may have been destroyed by
the explosion, for all that. When the geyser dropped,
it covered the place where our submarine ought to have
been. But you can see, Glennie, she isn't there."</p>

<p>Motor Matt had gone through many perils and difficulties
since he and his chums had started for "around
the Horn" with the <i>Grampus</i>, but he had never been so
greatly cast down as he was at that moment. He was
thinking of Carl, of Dick, and of the three brave men,
Speake, Gaines, and Clackett, who had stood shoulder to
shoulder with him through all the dangers that had
met them since leaving British Honduras.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that Glennie, at that moment, was
so hopeful.</p>

<p>"We haven't been able to see the <i>Grampus</i> for several
minutes, Matt," he observed. "In coming down the hill
from the casa, the boat was hidden from us."</p>

<p>"All the same, Glennie, she was in her berth, whether
we saw her or not. If she hadn't been where we left
her, the Japs wouldn't have had any target, and the
torpedo would not have been exploded in that spot. If
it comes to that, the fact that we didn't see her goes to
show that she may have changed her position a little, and
have been right where the torpedo exploded."</p>

<p>"I don't think that for a minute," averred Glennie
stoutly. "The last we saw of the <i>Grampus</i> all our friends
were on deck. If she had been torpedoed, we'd certainly
see some of the boys in the water. They were under
hatches when that Whitehead went off; and, if they were
under hatches, they may have been safe. I'm inclined to
think they were."</p>

<p>"If the bottom plates of the submarine were blown
in," proceeded Matt, "she would sink and go down like
so much lead. Let's get into the boat and row out,
Glennie. We can see a good deal more if we're right
over the spot where the <i>Grampus</i> was anchored than we
can from here."</p>

<p>Matt, suiting his action to the word, dropped hastily
over the edge of the wharf and into the boat. The
wharf was in a bad state of repair. The planks had
been torn from the piles, and a region of semi-darkness
stretched away under the floor.</p>

<p>As Matt dropped into the boat, his face was turned
landward and his eyes rested for a moment on the gloom
that lay between the outer piles and the shore; but,
during that moment, he glimpsed something that gave
him a start. Unless he was greatly mistaken, he could
make out the dim shape of a human form crouching in
the darkness.</p>

<p>"Cast off the painter, Glennie, quick!" he called.</p>

<p>The ensign lifted the loop over the top of the post
and flung it into the boat.</p>

<p>Grabbing the wharf planks, Matt gave a pull that
sent the boat in between the piles. He could hear shouts
of wild suspicion coming from Captain Pons and Captain
Arco. Unable to figure out what impelled Matt to
vanish under the wharf, they jumped to the conclusion
that he was doing something he ought not to do.</p>

<p>Paying no attention to the frantic voices, or the frenzied
tramping on the planks overhead, the young motorist
continued to drag the boat onward toward the shore.
Several yards back from the edge of the wharf, the bow
of the boat struck against a timber that had one end
imbedded in the sand, while the other end rose upward,
clear of the water.</p>

<p>The human form Matt had seen was lying upon the
timber. The man made no move to escape, or to protect
himself, and Matt was not long in discovering that he
was either dead or unconscious.</p>

<p>For a moment Matt's heart was in his throat. His
fears, even against his better judgment, made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
apprehensive that this form, lying helplessly on the timber
under the wharf, might be that of one of his friends.</p>

<p>Close examination, however, proved his fears groundless.
The man was under medium height and had a
tawny skin. He was barefooted, bareheaded, and stripped
to his waist. Rolling him into the boat, Matt drew the
light craft back into the daylight at the edge of the
wharf.</p>

<p>"What under the canopy are you about, Matt?" called
Glennie, from the edge of the wharf. Then, seeing the
man in the bottom of the boat, he gave vent to an astonished
whistle. "<i>That's</i> what you went under the
wharf for, eh? Where was that fellow?"</p>

<p>"He was lying on a timber, just out of the water,"
answered Matt. "The question is, where did he come
from, and what was he doing there?"</p>

<p>"He looks as though he was stripped for swimming."</p>

<p>"And he worked so hard in the water, and in getting
ashore, that he gave out and lost consciousness as soon
as he pulled himself upon that timber. The fact that
he was under the wharf proves that he didn't want anybody
to find him. He's a Jap, Glennie."</p>

<p>A yell escaped Captain Pons, and he began talking
excitedly and pointing his finger at the Jap.</p>

<p>"What does Pons say, Glennie?" Matt asked.</p>

<p>"He says that that fellow was one of the men who
stole the <i>Pom</i>. The captain is very sure he is not
mistaken. There were five in the party."</p>

<p>"Gif the r-r-rascal here!" cried Captain Pons, stretching
his arms downward, "gif heem to me! By gar, he
is one of ze t'ieves&mdash;ve haf captured one of ze t'ieves!"</p>

<p>Matt lifted the unconscious man, and three pairs of
hands caught him from above and pulled him up on the
wharf. Hardly had the Jap touched the planks than,
with amazing suddenness, he jumped to his feet and
tried to run.</p>

<p>"He was shamming!" exclaimed Glennie.</p>

<p>"No," answered Matt, as the two negroes deftly caught
the fleeing Jap and flung him roughly down on his back,
"I'm positive he was not shamming, Glennie. He recovered
while we were lifting him to the wharf and
thought he could make a bolt and get away."</p>

<p>As the two negroes held the prisoner down on the
planks, Captain Pons stepped to his side, bent over, and
shook a fist in his face.</p>

<p>What the captain said was in Spanish, which he probably
used for the Jap's benefit, and Matt could not follow
his words further than to be sure that Pons was
threatening and reviling the man for the treacherous part
he and his countrymen had played.</p>

<p>The prisoner looked up calmly into the Frenchman's
face, seeming to take his capture and his failure to
escape as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"We get the torpedo," said he, in good English, the
moment Captain Pons ceased talking.</p>

<p>"How did you get the torpedo?" queried Glennie, pushing
the captain aside and drawing closer to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I volunteered," went on the Jap, a note of ringing exultation
in his low voice; "they passed me through the
torpedo tube, and I cut the cable that secured the torpedo
to the other submarine, and made a rope fast from
our boat. It was hard work, all under water. Then I
swim ashore, but I am weak and faint and try to hide.
You have captured me. Do what you will. <i>Banzai</i>,
Nippon!"</p>

<p>The Chilian could not understand English, and he was
consumed with curiosity. Captain Pons understood, however,
and the calmness of the prisoner, during his brief
recital, filled him with rage. He tried to strike the Jap,
but Glennie interfered.</p>

<p>"Let him alone, Pons!" cried Glennie. "He thinks he
has done right. Anyhow, he's a prisoner, and a prisoner
should not be mistreated."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" ground out the captain. "He make ze brag
zat he steal ze torpedo! S-scoundr-r-el! He should
be hang', by gar!"</p>

<p>Glennie turned to Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"You heard, Matt?" he queried. "The Japs passed
this fellow out through the torpedo tube of the <i>Pom</i>
while the boat was under water. He made a line fast,
cut the cable securing the torpedo to our submarine, and
then swam ashore. A rare piece of work!"</p>

<p>"Ask him about that torpedo attack on the <i>Grampus</i>,"
said Matt. "See if you can find out anything about the
intentions of the other Japs."</p>

<p>"You are one of the Sons of the Rising Sun?" queried
Glennie, again addressing the prisoner.</p>

<p>A gleam darted through the Jap's eyes.</p>

<p>"I say nothing," he answered. "I have told about
the torpedo. But I tell you nothing more. It is all for
Nippon, for my beloved country."</p>

<p>"That's the way with those fellows," said Matt disappointedly.
"He wouldn't speak another word even if
he was tortured. I'm surprised that he said what he did
about the torpedo. Turn him over to Pons and the
captain of the port, Glennie, and let's row out into the
bay and see if we can learn anything about the fate of
the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>Matt's face was haggard with fear and anxiety. He
had had a bad half hour, since the explosion of the
torpedo and the disappearance of the <i>Grampus</i>, and his
face reflected the intensity of his feelings.</p>

<p>Glennie turned away from the prisoner and stepped to
the edge of the wharf. He paused there for a moment,
rigid as a statue, his eyes wandering over the surface of
the bay.</p>

<p>Motor Matt, wondering at his manner, likewise directed
his gaze off over the water. As he did so, Glennie
recovered his wits abruptly and gave vent to an exultant
yell.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he roared, jerking off his cap and waving
it. "What's the matter with the motor boys, Matt?
We've had our worry all for nothing!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CHASING A TORPEDO.</p>


<p>Dick and Carl, together with the rest of the crew of
the <i>Grampus</i>, did a lot of guessing after Matt and Glennie
left them with the captain of the port.</p>

<p>The commotion kicked up by the torpedo put a sudden
and effectual stop to their speculations. Carl, Dick,
and Speake were on deck when the Whitehead began its
peculiar performance, and the jerks administered to the
<i>Grampus</i> by the tow line quickly brought Gaines and
Clackett up through the tower hatch.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" cried Carl. "See vonce vat has habbened
mit der dorpeto. A vale has got dangled oop mit
der tow line; oder oof id don'd vas a vale id vas a shark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
und a pig feller, I bed you. Vat a funny pitzness!
From der actions, id looks like der dorpeto vas alife."</p>

<p>"Whale!" scoffed Dick. "Don't you believe that a
whale, or shark, either, has got anything to do with
that."</p>

<p>"Vat it iss, den?"</p>

<p>"I give it up. What do you think, Speake?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easy," answered Speake. "Mebby
something has got loose inside the torpedo&mdash;compressed
air, or something&mdash;and that that is what's putting the big
tube through its jig."</p>

<p>"Led's pull in der line," suggested Carl, "und make der
dorpeto pehave."</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" cried Dick. "It's full of dynamite,
and I'll never let the <i>Grampus</i> get any closer to that infernal
machine than she is now."</p>

<p>"Matt vants dot dorpeto or he vouldn't haf taken der
drouple to tow her in."</p>

<p>"Matt can have it, matey, but I don't intend to board
a Whitehead when it's dancing a hornpipe. If the dynamite
should happen to let go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick was interrupted by a chorus of surprised yells
from the rest of his companions.</p>

<p>The torpedo, kicking one end high in the air, had
taken a "header" toward the bottom of the bay.</p>

<p>"Dot means goot-by," murmured the amazed Carl.
"Der vale's run off mit it. Bedder dot vale look a leedle
oudt und not knock his tail too hardt against der dorpeto.
Oof he do dot, den, py shinks, he make some
mincemeat out oof himseluf."</p>

<p>"Great guns!" exclaimed Gaines. "What do you suppose
did that, Dick?"</p>

<p>"More mysterious things have happened to us since we
left Magellan Strait," ruminated Dick, "than ever came
our way before. Suppose we haul in on the tow line and
have a look at the end of it."</p>

<p>The line was pulled aboard. There were some forty
feet of it, and the end was sliced off clean.</p>

<p>"A knife did that!" declared Clackett.</p>

<p>"Der vale dit id mit his teet'," asserted Carl, who
always hung to one of his own theories like a dog to
a bone.</p>

<p>"Bosh, Clackett!" scoffed Gaines. "How could a knife
have done that? Who was down there to cut the rope?"</p>

<p>"It don't make any difference what separated the
rope," put in Speake, "the thing was done, and something
or other is running away with Motor Matt's torpedo.
Matt must have wanted that Whitehead or he
wouldn't have gone to the trouble to tow it in. Are
we going to let it get away from us?"</p>

<p>"How can we help it?" inquired Clackett.</p>

<p>"We can follow it," asserted Speake.</p>

<p>"We haven't any business taking the <i>Grampus</i> from
her anchorage while Matt's ashore," said Gaines.</p>

<p>"I guess Matt wouldn't mind if we took a dive along
the bottom of the bay to overhaul that runaway torpedo,"
remarked Dick.</p>

<p>"Sure, nod!" chimed in Carl. "Matt vill be as madt
as some vet hens ven ve tell him der dorpeto skyhooted
avay mit itseluf und ve ditn't do nodding to shdop id."</p>

<p>"We'll chance it, anyway, mates," said Dick. "I'm
always in command whenever our old raggie is off the
boat. Get down to the motor, Gaines. Clackett, get
after the tanks. Come below, the rest of you, and let
the last man down secure the hatch."</p>

<p>Speake was the last one to drop down the hatch. The
ballast tanks were already filling as he stepped off the
iron ladder upon the floor of the periscope room.</p>

<p>Dick was at the wheel.</p>

<p>"Turn on the electric projector, Speake," said Dick.
"I'm going up into the tower and do the steering from
there."</p>

<p>Dick got just two rounds up the ladder when a muffled
roar enveloped the <i>Grampus</i>, and she was heaved
violently over until the tower was almost on a level with
her keel.</p>

<p>Carl, who had been inspecting the periscope, was thrown
violently against the rounded wall over the locker.
Speake, just reaching up to turn the electric switch that
sent a current through the wires of the projector, went
head over heels against one of the bulkheads. As for
Dick, he pulled off a remarkable stunt at ground and
lofty tumbling, winding up with his head under the
periscope table and his heels in the air.</p>

<p>Yells came in muffled volume from below, proving
that Gaines and Clackett were likewise having their
troubles.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> righted herself almost as quickly as
she had flopped over. This, taking place before those
aboard had had a chance to adjust themselves, still
further complicated matters.</p>

<p>When every one was finally right side up, Dick jumped
to the speaking tubes.</p>

<p>"How are you down there, Gaines?" he called.</p>

<p>"I turned a handspring over the motor," came back
the voice of Gaines, "but I guess I didn't damage anything."</p>

<p>"I stood on my head in one of the accumulators,"
added Clackett through the tank-room tube. "We turned
turtle there for about half a minute. What caused it,
Dick? I heard an explosion, too."</p>

<p>"That bally old torpedo must have gone off," answered
Dick. "No use hunting for it now."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was that torpedo that exploded,"
said Speake. "What could have set it off?"</p>

<p>"Der vale shlowed oop a leedle," explained Carl, "und
id run indo him. I bed you somet'ing for nodding dere
iss vale all ofer der pay."</p>

<p>"We're in luck, anyhow," exulted Dick. "This old
flugee is as trim and steady as ever. Now that we're
down near the bottom we'll cruise a little and see what
we can discover. We've got an hour or two, I guess,
before Matt and Glennie get back to the landing and
want to come aboard. Slow speed, Gaines," he called.</p>

<p>Hurrying up into the conning tower, Dick pressed his
eyes against the forward lunettes. The trail of light,
reaching out through the lunette, illuminated the murky
waters for several yards beyond the point of the submarine's
bow.</p>

<p>There was a commotion in the depths, and fishes were
darting in all directions.</p>

<p>Steering from the ladder, Dick headed the <i>Grampus</i>
toward the north. They had not gone far before Dick
saw something which made him rub his eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I doing a calk," he muttered, "or are these
lamps of mine making a monkey's fist of their work?
Strike me lucky! Carl! Look into the periscope!"</p>

<p>A vague shape was passing through the gleam of the
search light. It looked like a huge cigar, its pointed end
tilted slightly upward. At the rear of the object there
was a flurry of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Id's a vale!" boomed Carl, whose mind seemed to
be running on whales that day.</p>

<p>"It's another submarine," gasped Speake, "that's what
it is. I wonder if Matt didn't know there was another
submarine in these waters?"</p>

<p>"Watch!" cried Dick excitedly. "What's that behind
the thing?"</p>

<p>The other boat was moving in a course that angled
slightly with the direction the <i>Grampus</i> was following.
Because of this the second craft was some time in
passing through the glow of the search light.</p>

<p>As Dick called out, those at the periscope table saw
the Whitehead torpedo glide into the gleam from the
electric projector. A rope held the forward end of the
torpedo to the stern of the other submarine, the buoyancy
of the steel cylinder causing its rear part to stand almost
straight up in the water.</p>

<p>It was an odd procession the boat and the torpedo
made as they defiled through the pencil of light.</p>

<p>"Dot's der feller vat shtole Matt's dorpeto!" cried
Carl. "Run against der rope, Tick, und preak der dorpeto
loose."</p>

<p>"Not much, I won't, matey," breathed Dick. "We're
not going to take any chances with <i>that</i> Whitehead."</p>

<p>"It certainly wasn't that torpedo that went off, a little
while ago, Dick," observed Speake.</p>

<p>"Right-o," Dick answered, startled by the thought this
remark of Speake's had aroused. "It was a torpedo,
though, and that other craft must have launched it at
us."</p>

<p>"Ach, himmelblitzen!" gasped Carl. "For vy should
dot odder poat shoot some dorpetos ad us, hey?"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Carl, unless there are some of those Sons
of the Rising Sun aboard."</p>

<p>Dick slid down the ladder in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Empty the tanks, Clackett!" he sang out. "We've
got to hustle out of this," he added to Carl and Speake,
"before they shoot another Whitehead at us. Keelhaul
me, but this will be news for Matt. We've got to tell
him about it as soon as ever we can get the <i>Grampus</i>
back to her old berth."</p>

<p>Two minutes later the submarine lifted her turtle-like
back out of the waves. Dick headed her south, and Carl
and Speake pushed open the hatch and went out on the
wet plates. Dick ascended the ladder to steer from the
hatch. Hardly had he got head and shoulders into the
outside air when a shout from Carl and Speake drew
his eyes toward the wharf.</p>

<p>Matt and Glennie, and a few more the boys did not
know, were on the landing. Glennie was yelling and
waving his cap.</p>

<p>"Vat's der madder mit him, I vonder?" queried Carl.
"He vouldn't be doing dot oof he knowed aboudt dot
odder poat und der dorpeto."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NORTHWARD BOUND.</p>


<p>The <i>Grampus</i> had no more than dropped anchor in her
old berth than Matt, Glennie, Captain Pons, the captain
of the port, and the negroes were alongside in the boat.</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs," cried Matt, "but you fellows
gave me a scare."</p>

<p>"Vell, bard," answered Carl, "ve vas a leedle schared
ourselufs."</p>

<p>"Here's another scare for you, matey," called Dick.
"The Sons of the Rising Sun have a submarine of their
own, and are after us. They were here, off Lota, and
just went north with that torpedo in tow."</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" exclaimed Glennie. "How did you fellows
know that?"</p>

<p>"You act as though it wasn't any news to you."</p>

<p>"It isn't, but we thought you fellows were not informed
and would fall a victim to the <i>Pom</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Pom?</i>" echoed Dick.</p>

<p>"That's the name of the other submarine," went on
Matt. "She's a French craft and was brought here by
this man, Captain Pons, to be turned over to the Chilian
government. Five Japs worked a trick and succeeded
in getting hold of her."</p>

<p>"Why, how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll tell you all about it later, Dick. Where were
you when that torpedo went off?"</p>

<p>"Just diving to the bottom to go hunting for the other
torpedo. That Whitehead they fired never touched us."</p>

<p>"It must have touched something," put in Speake, "or
the firing pin wouldn't have got in its work."</p>

<p>"It hit a harbor buoy," said Matt. "At least, the
captain of the port says there was a buoy at this point.
As it isn't here now, it must have been demolished. It's
a lucky thing for all of us that the buoy was between the
<i>Grampus</i> and the Whitehead. Glennie and I will go back
to the shore, Dick, and get a barrel of gasoline. You
get the hose rigged and have everything ready to discharge
the gasoline in short order. We're northward
bound, and are going to get away from these waters
just as quick as the nation will let us."</p>

<p>There was something of a disappointment in this for
the men on the submarine. They had hoped for a
chance to stretch their legs ashore, but they appreciated
the necessity of getting the <i>Grampus</i> out of harm's way
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"Won't the <i>Pom</i> lay for us as we pull out of the
bay, Matt?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"She can't lay for us. You see, she had only two torpedoes.
One of those was destroyed in the attack made
on the <i>Grampus</i> in the bay; the other one the <i>Pom</i> is
dragging off to some place where she can get it in shape
for work. We need not fear any attack from the Sons of
the Rising Sun until the other Whitehead is ready for
use. If we act quickly, we can get well away from the
<i>Pom</i> before she becomes dangerous."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" rasped out Captain Pons. "Is it ze American
vay to r-run from ze enemy? Pur-r-r-soo and capture,
zat is ze sing. I will go wiz you, <i>oui</i>, I, myself,
Captain Pons. You will help me get back ze <i>Pom</i>.
Eh?"</p>

<p>"We're not here to take any risks with the <i>Grampus</i>,
captain," said Matt. "Responsibility for the safety of
the boat rests on my shoulders, and you'll have to
get some Chilian war ship to help you."</p>

<p>"Zat is not right!" cried the captain. "One mariner
is in ze duty bound to help anozzer mariner in ze distress.
Me, I call on you. You refuse, zen zat is mos'
contemptible."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you look at it in that way, captain," replied
Matt; "but it's just possible I know my own business
better than you do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Pons had a little fit all by himself, and while
he had it he was saying unpleasant things.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the frog eater?" cried Dick.
"Throw him overboard!"</p>

<p>Matt signed for the captain of the port to have the
negro oarsmen get the boat back to the landing. The
captain at once gave the order and the boat danced
away in the direction of the wharf.</p>

<p>Captain Pons was still calling down anathemas on the
heads of all Americans who refused to help a Frenchman
in "ze distress."</p>

<p>"By gar," he cried, "I vill vire my government how
you haf treat' me! I vill use ze cable, and let ze president
of my country know it all. It is mos' contemptible!"</p>

<p>"Captain," said Matt, "we are not allowed to take any
strangers aboard the <i>Grampus</i>. Our submarine has appliances
which put her so far ahead of every other boat
in her class that we are all under seal of secrecy and
are bound by a pledge to keep strangers away. So, you
see, it would be impossible for you to take a cruise in
the <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>Captain Pons glared.</p>

<p>"It is mos' contemptible!" was all he could say.</p>

<p>Matt and Glennie, without delaying further, pushed
into the town. Matt had little difficulty in finding the
gasoline he wanted. He had to go to two or three
places before he found fuel that answered the severe
tests he put it to, but finally he got what he desired and
had it hauled to the landing.</p>

<p>The captain of the port was not in evidence, but his
two negroes were waiting at the boat.</p>

<p>Matt had come down to the wharf in the wagon that
brought the gasoline, and Glennie had been left to follow
on foot. The ensign put in an appearance just as the
barrel had been transferred to the boat. Matt was surprised
to see him carrying a rifle.</p>

<p>The only firearms aboard the <i>Grampus</i> consisted of a
six-shooter which had accompanied the ensign when he
first assumed his duties on the submarine.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with that, Glennie?"
laughed Matt. "Shoot Japs?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly," answered Glennie, "There
are a good many ways in which a weapon of this sort
might come in handy, besides using it for shooting Japs.
It's an American gun, Matt&mdash;a Marlin. It looked sort
of homelike, so I just took it in, along with a box of
cartridges."</p>

<p>If Matt hated one thing more than another, it was a
gun. He had seen firearms used so recklessly while he
was in the Southwest that he had acquired a strong
prejudice against them. Notwithstanding this fact, he
was a crack shot, and had more than once carried off
the prize in a shooting contest.</p>

<p>"All right, Glennie," said he, although a trifle reluctantly,
"bring it along."</p>

<p>"You don't like guns, Matt," observed the ensign as
he lowered himself into the boat and dropped down on
one of the thwarts.</p>

<p>"Or knives, either," added Matt, "when they are
used to get the better of another fellow. A pair of fists
make pretty good weapons."</p>

<p>"Fists are all right," laughed Glennie, "so long as
the other chap uses them; but when you find an enemy
standing off forty or fifty feet and looking at you over
the sights of a gun&mdash;well, that's the time another gun
would be mighty valuable."</p>

<p>By the time the small boat fell in alongside the <i>Grampus</i>,
Dick, Carl, and the rest had the hose ready and it
took only a few moments to rig the pump. Presently the
gasoline was flowing down the tower hatch and into the
reservoir below.</p>

<p>Dick, keeping one eye on the negroes while they bent
over the pump handles, leaned against the conning tower
and heaved a long breath.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping, old ship," said he to Matt, "that we'll be
able to leave the Japs behind, this time, for good and
all. Those on the <i>Pom</i> must have seen us while we had
their craft under our search light, and I guessed good
and hard why they didn't turn and send another torpedo
at us. I didn't know, you see, that they only had two
Whiteheads to their blessed name. We could have pulled
their fangs if we had opened up that torpedo and took
out the dynamite."</p>

<p>"I intended," answered Matt, "to take the torpedo
aboard through one of our tubes as soon as we reached
this harbor, but the captain of the port came down on us
before I had the chance."</p>

<p>"How did you find out about that submarine, and the
Japs being in charge of her?"</p>

<p>Matt straightened out this point to his chum's satisfaction.
That part of Matt's recital which had to do
with the Jap who had been captured under the wharf
was particularly interesting to Dick.</p>

<p>"Those fellows don't care a rap for their own lives,"
muttered Dick, "and that's what makes 'em such nasty
fighters. When that fellow got out through the <i>Pom's</i>
torpedo tube, he must have come up directly under the
Whitehead. By hugging the torpedo close, he could have
got his head out of water without any of us on the
<i>Grampus</i> seeing him. But he took long chances, just
the same, and there are only four Japs left to navigate
the other craft. The work probably calls for all hands,
and there's bound to be a time when the <i>Pom</i> can't run
for lack of hands to navigate her. The Japs are only
human, and they'll have to have a spell of rest like every
one else."</p>

<p>"We've got a good chance to show them our heels,"
said Matt, "and it's our duty to make the most of it."</p>

<p>"I'm a Fiji, though," said Dick, "if I don't hate to
run away from those Sons of the Rising Sun. It looks
as though the United States and Great Britain had
struck their colors to the yellow rascals."</p>

<p>"I feel the same way, Dick, but this submarine is worth
a hundred thousand dollars, and we're only her trustees.
It's our duty not to take any chances with her."</p>

<p>"Right-o, matey. I understand that just as well as
you do. Captain Nemo, Jr., ought to give you a good
slice of that hundred thousand when you tie up the
<i>Grampus</i> at the navy-yard wharf."</p>

<p>"I'm not looking for that, Dick," returned Motor Matt
earnestly. "It's the idea of <i>making good</i> that appeals to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
me beyond anything and everything else. It isn't so
much the money that comes to us for what we do, but
the way we toe the scratch that counts."</p>

<p>An hour later all preliminaries were finished and the
<i>Grampus</i> was off up the bay, tanks emptied and steel
hull high in the water, her motors humming and setting
a record pace.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A HALT FOR REPAIRS.</p>


<p>Late in the afternoon of the day they left Lota Bay
the <i>Grampus</i> spoke the British ship <i>Sovereign</i>, bound
from Santiago to Liverpool. By means of a megaphone,
Matt had a brief talk with the captain of the sailing
vessel.</p>

<p>"What craft is that?" inquired the British captain, after
answering Matt's hail with information concerning his
own vessel.</p>

<p>"The submarine <i>Grampus</i>," answered Matt, "six
weeks out from Belize, British Honduras, and bound for
San Francisco."</p>

<p>"My word!" came from the other megaphone. "Sure
about that?"</p>

<p>Matt was "stumped." It was certainly an odd question
to ask.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sure of it. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, we passed another submarine, two hours ago,
and she was towing a torpedo. Said she had discharged
it at a target and was going to beach it somewhere, and
get it in shape for further use. But the bally joke of
it is that the captain of that other submarine said that <i>his</i>
boat was the United States submarine <i>Grampus</i>. It's
a main queer go if there are two submarines of that
name both belonging to the United States Government."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" muttered Glennie,
leaning out of the hatch. "The nerve of it!"</p>

<p>"That other boat was the <i>Pom</i>," called back Matt,
"sent over to Chili by a firm of French shipbuilders. She
was stolen from the harbor of Lota by a handful of
Japs."</p>

<p>"Fancy that! Those Japs are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of it Matt could not hear. The two boats
had merely spoken each other in passing and were
quickly out of reach of each other's megaphones.</p>

<p>"Those Sons of the Rising Sun are stealing our thunder,"
remarked Glennie.</p>

<p>"I suppose," returned Matt, "that it's a heap safer
for the Japs to call their boat the <i>Grampus</i> than the <i>Pom</i>.
If they happened to speak a vessel that knew of the
stealing of the <i>Pom</i> results might prove disastrous if
they told the truth."</p>

<p>Matt descended to the periscope room to give the news
to Carl and Dick.</p>

<p>"Dot's der vorst yet!" grunted Carl. "Der itee oof
dem Chaps calling deir old frog-eader poat der <i>Grampus</i>!
I don'd like dot. Id vas some insulds."</p>

<p>"I guess we can stand it, Carl," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Did Pons tell you anything about that French submarine,
matey?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"A little, but not as much as I would have liked to
learn. The <i>Pom</i>, I infer, is smaller than the <i>Grampus</i>,
and is propelled by electricity when submerged and by
gasoline on the surface. She's only able to stay under
water an hour. Captain Nemo, Jr., could teach those
French builders a trick or two with his patent submerged
exhausts."</p>

<p>"How's her diving? Can't she remain submerged
longer than an hour with her ballast tanks full and her
electric motor quiet?"</p>

<p>"No. Her rudders keep her below the surface, and
the diving rudders won't work unless her motor's
going."</p>

<p>"She don'd amoundt to mooch, oof dot's der case,"
commented Carl. "Der <i>Grampus</i> has got der <i>Pom</i>
shkinned bot' vays for Suntay. I bed you somet'ing for
nodding der <i>Pom</i> couldn't have come aroundt der bottom
end oof Sout' America like vat ve dit. <i>Pom!</i> She vas
vat der French fellers call a <i>pomme de terre</i>, by vich,
ven I so expression meinseluf, I mean a botato.
Whoosh!" and the Dutch boy gave a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>The night fell clear and bright. It was Matt's intention
to continue running during the night, but submerged
so that only the periscope ball was awash.</p>

<p>When the time came to fill the ballast tanks, however,
an unexpected difficulty presented itself&mdash;a difficulty
which had almost brought overwhelming disaster
once before, when the <i>Grampus</i> had just emerged from
Magellan Strait: the Kingston valves by mean of which
the tanks were operated failed to work.</p>

<p>This was no particular fault of the valves, but of some
damage that had been done to them, and which caused
them to go wrong occasionally&mdash;and usually at the most
inopportune times.</p>

<p>Matt had made up his mind that new valves would
have to be put in, but that was a job which would necessarily
have to wait until the submarine reached the end of
her long journey.</p>

<p>Repairing the valves would take several hours, and
Matt decided to stay on the surface and put in a little
bay on Quiriquina Island.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to reach the island before morning
and when Dick relieved Gaines at the motor, a call
for half speed went through the speaking tube to the
motor room.</p>

<p>The young motorist studied his charts, then, with the
surroundings of the islands clearly in mind, took the
steering wheel himself and laid his course by compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about five o'clock in the morning when the
<i>Grampus</i> rounded a bluff headland and took a due east
course across Tona Bay. Quiriquina Island loomed up
clear and distinct against the gray dawn hovering in the
eastern skies.</p>

<p>The cove which Matt selected as a berth for the submarine
while repairs were being made had a sloping
beach of white sand. It was virtually a bay within a bay,
and the waters were as calm as those of an inland lake.</p>

<p>As soon as the anchors were down, all hands came on
deck to get a whiff of the morning air.</p>

<p>"We'd better have breakfast before we tackle the
valves, hadn't we, Matt?" inquired Speake. "I know
I can work better on a full stomach, and I suppose the
rest of you can."</p>

<p>"Good idea, Speake," returned Matt. "I had thought
about that, but supposed you would like to loaf a little
and not pen yourself up in the torpedo room with an
electric stove."</p>

<p>"Those confounded valves bother me," grumbled
Speake, "and I couldn't loaf and enjoy myself if I had
to think about them."</p>

<p>"They bother me, too," added Glennie, "and I believe
I'll go below and look them over."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Clackett. "We can make a
preliminary survey and then get busy right after breakfast.
Plenty of chance to loaf during my watch below."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you fellows so industrious," laughed Matt.
"Perhaps, if you are real smart, you can get those valves
fixed by breakfast time, and the rest of us won't have to
tinker with them."</p>

<p>"You'll be needed, Matt, when it comes to the fixing,"
answered Glennie, as he climbed into the conning
tower.</p>

<p>Clackett followed him.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go down, too," yawned Gaines, "and
catch forty winks on top of the periscope-room locker.
This morning air is fine, but I'm satisfied to take my
share through the open hatch."</p>

<p>He followed Clackett into the tower. Dick, descending
to the edge of the rounded deck, peered into the clear
depths of the water below.</p>

<p>"I can see our cable, mates," said he, "and our anchor
with one fluke in the sand. Come on, Carl. Let's take
a swim before breakfast."</p>

<p>"Nod me, Tick," answered Carl. "I feel like loafing,
und shvimming iss too mooch like vork."</p>

<p>"How about you, Matt?"</p>

<p>"I feel as Carl does," said Matt. "Take your swim
if you want to, Dick, and Carl and I will be the anchor
watch."</p>

<p>Dick was out of his clothes in a jiffy. "So long,"
he called, as he took a "header" from the bow of the
boat.</p>

<p>He was perfectly at home in the water, and when Matt
saw him swimming out toward a headland that walled in
the cove on the south, he thought little of it. When he
saw that Dick was intending to swim around the point,
however, he stood up and called out a warning. But
Dick only laughed and kept on until he was out of sight.</p>

<p>"He von't go so far dot he can't ged pack again,"
remarked Carl. "He iss like a fish, Tick iss, und he
feels pedder in der vater as oudt oof id."</p>

<p>Carl, for some days, had been wearing an outfit of
sailor togs which he had found in the slop chest of the
submarine. He was trying to be as nautical as possible,
so that he could "shiver his timbers" and "dash his deadeyes"
with the best of them when the <i>Grampus</i> reached
San Francisco.</p>

<p>"I can valk like a sailor," remarked Carl, getting up
from his seat by the tower, "und aboudt all I lack now iss
to be aple to hitch oop my drousers like vat a sailor
does. How iss der vay oof it, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that part of it, Carl," laughed Matt.
"You'll be enough of a sailor at the end of this cruise,
even if you don't know how to hitch up your trousers.
Besides," and Matt squinted at him critically, "I doubt
if you could ever do the trick."</p>

<p>"For vy nod?"</p>

<p>"Why, the trousers are too tight a fit around the
waist."</p>

<p>"Yah, so, aber dey're so pig a fit oop und down dot I
valk on der pottoms, und id iss eider hitch dem oop oder
cut dem off. Now, vatch. Meppy id goes like dis."</p>

<p>Carl jumped into the air, grapped the band of the
trousers with one hand in front and the other behind,
and kicked out his legs. When he came down, his feet
were so far apart that they slipped on the rounded
plates, and he went down and rolled over and over.
Matt grabbed him just in the nick of time to keep him
out of the water.</p>

<p>"Look out," warned Matt, "or you'll take a swim
whether you want to or not."</p>

<p>"I guess dot I leaf der hitching pitzness oudt," said
the chagrined Carl, "aber id vas so bicturesque dot I vish
I could manach id. Now, ven I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl was interrupted by a shout, wafted toward them
from across the cove. He and Matt started up and saw
Dick swimming in their direction with all his might.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Dick?" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Sharks!" came back the breathless answer.</p>

<p>Matt was no more than a second making up his mind
what he should do. To help Dick by bringing the
<i>Grampus</i> closer to him was out of the question&mdash;disaster
might overtake the young sailor before the anchor could
be lifted from the bottom.</p>

<p>"Ach, himmelblitzen!" murmured Carl fearfully. "Vat
ve going to do, Matt?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Below with you, quick!" flung back the king of the
motor boys. "Glennie's rifle is in the periscope room. Get
that and a coil of rope and hustle back here."</p>

<p>Carl, shaking with excitement, hurried to carry out
the order. As he vanished into the tower, Matt went forward
toward the bow of the boat, keeping his keen eyes
on Dick.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DICK MAKES A DISCOVERY.</p>


<p>The ability of the king of the motor boys to "keep
his head" in trying situations had more than once turned
the tide for himself and his chums. Matt could become
as excited as anybody, but excitement never interfered
with the steadiness of his nerves or with his ability to
think quickly and resourcefully in time of danger.</p>

<p>Far beyond Dick Matt could see a black, triangular
fin slitting the water, tacking this way and that, but
coming closer and closer to the young sailor.</p>

<p>Dick was swimming rapidly, but the shark, of course,
was cutting through the water at a much faster gait.
Had the shark laid a straight course for its intended victim,
the latter would long since have been overtaken.</p>

<p>With a keen eye Motor Matt made a quick estimate
of the distance separating Dick and the shark from the
boat. He concluded that Dick could not by any possibility
reach the <i>Grampus</i> before the shark would be upon
him, but the sea scavenger would be close enough for a
good shot.</p>

<p>Carl, in a veritable tremor of excitement, rolled over
the top of the conning tower with the rifle in one hand
and a coil of rope in the other.</p>

<p>"Don'd led dot shark ged avay mit Tick," he pleaded,
handing the rifle to Matt. "Pud a pullet righdt indo dot
shark, Matt, mitoudt vaiting any longer as bossiple."</p>

<p>"I've got to wait until I can get a good shot, Carl,"
answered Matt, "and that time will come when the
shark goes over on its back."</p>

<p>"Ven id does dot," quavered Carl, "id iss retty to bite.
Oof you make a miss, Matt, id iss all ofer mit Tick."</p>

<p>"I'll not make a miss. Get a clamp on your nerves and
be ready to throw the rope as soon as Dick comes near
enough."</p>

<p>"My teet' chatter a leedle," whimpered Carl, "aber my
nerfs iss all righdt. Don'd you be afraidt pecause I am,
Tick," he cried. "Schvim like der Olt Poy vas afder
you!"</p>

<p>Dick had need of all his breath and could not waste
any in useless words. He was coming through the
water at a fierce clip, his arms working like piston rods
in a fine, steady, overhand stroke. He could see Matt
on the deck with the rifle ready, and he knew that whatever
the king of the motor boys could do would be done.</p>

<p>"Ach, shood, shood!" implored Carl, watching the
black fin zigzagging nearer and nearer. "Don'd vait,
Matt!"</p>

<p>But Matt paid no attention to Carl. He knew what
kind of a target he wanted, and that the shark would give
it to him if he waited.</p>

<p>When Dick was about a dozen feet from the boat, the
right moment came. With a flip of its tail the shark
leaped partly out of the water and turned on its back,
its great jaws opening.</p>

<p>Matt had braced himself firmly and lifted the Marlin
repeater to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Fire avay, kevick!" clamored Carl, and just then Matt
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>It was a bull's-eye hit. Straight to its mark leaped
the murderous bit of lead, and the shark, stunned by the
impact of the bullet, snapped its jaws harmlessly together
and sank downward in the reddening water.</p>

<p>"You're all right, Dick!" cried Matt. "Toss the rope,
Carl."</p>

<p>Carl threw the line and Dick laid hold of it. The report
of the rifle brought Gaines from the periscope room,
Glennie and Clackett from the tank room, and Speake
from the torpedo room in short order. All of them were
on the deck just as Matt and Carl assisted Dick out of
the water.</p>

<p>"What's the rumpus?" inquired Gaines.</p>

<p>Matt pointed to the shark, which was floating, belly
up, on the water.</p>

<p>"Your rifle did it, Glennie," said Matt. "If it hadn't
been for that, nothing could have saved Dick. I didn't
think there was a shark within miles of us when Dick
went into the water."</p>

<p>Dick was nearly fagged. The tremendous exertion he
had put forth had tried him severely.</p>

<p>"It was foolish of me to go around that point," said
Dick, leaning back against the conning tower, "but I'm
glad I did."</p>

<p>"Dot's funny," returned Carl. "Glad you vent aroundt
der point und shdirred oop dot shark! How you make
dot oudt?"</p>

<p>"Well, I made a discovery," went on Dick. "If I
hadn't made that discovery, like enough I'd have kept
on swimming and have got so far away the shark would
surely have nipped me before I could have got back
close enough for Matt to shoot."</p>

<p>"What was the discovery?" asked Glennie.</p>

<p>"There's another cove around the point, a good deal
like this one. The <i>Pom</i> is there, close inshore, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Der Chaps!" breathed Carl, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"The <i>Pom</i>!" exclaimed Glennie.</p>

<p>"Here's a piece of luck!" ground out Gaines. "Who'd
have thought we'd moor ship alongside the same island
picked out by the Japs! There seems to be a fatality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
about our dealings with these Sons of the Rising Sun.
Even after we dodge them we have the knack of dropping
right into their hands again."</p>

<p>"Mebby," suggested Speake, "they saw us and followed
us to the island."</p>

<p>"Hardly that, mate," spoke up Dick. "They've beached
that torpedo, and all four of the Japs are ashore, tinkering
with it."</p>

<p>Matt was puzzled to know what to do. If the Japs
had not heard the rifle shot, it would be possible for the
<i>Grampus</i> to haul in her anchor and slip away, unnoticed,
providing the tank valves were repaired and she could
leave the bay under water. But this man&oelig;uvre would
leave a threatening danger behind, and Matt and his
friend would never feel safe from an unexpected attack.</p>

<p>In that critical moment, Motor Matt would have given
a deal if he could have known all about the <i>Pom</i> and her
capabilities. For a few moments he stood on the deck,
turning the situation over and over in his mind, his eyes
on the point around which lay the hostile submarine.</p>

<p>"How far is the <i>Pom</i> anchored off the shore, Dick?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Not more than half a cable's length."</p>

<p>"Do you think the Japs saw you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they didn't&mdash;they were too busy with that
torpedo. But they may have heard me yell, or the report
of that gun may have reached them. They have good
ears, those fellows."</p>

<p>"Get into your clothes, Dick," said Matt, having at
last made up his mind as to what he should do. "After
that, take the rifle and sit here on the deck. Watch that
point of land. If the Japs fix that torpedo so they are
able to use it, they will have to come around the point
in order to launch it at us. Finish getting the breakfast,
Speake. Gaines will pass it around as soon as you have
it ready. Clackett and I will go below and see what we
can do with those valves. Don't bother us with any
breakfast until we have them once more in working order."</p>

<p>"What are Carl and I to do, Matt?" inquired Glennie.</p>

<p>"Stay up here with Dick, and keep your eyes peeled."</p>

<p>Matt, Clackett, and Speake went below. Matt and
Clackett were an hour at the valves before they were
finally made dependable. All the while they were at
work a deep silence reigned throughout the boat. Every
one realized the necessity of keeping quiet so as not to
arouse the Japs.</p>

<p>Matt, after swallowing a cup of coffee, came out on
deck and began taking off his clothes.</p>

<p>"What's the game, matey?" asked Dick. "You're not
going into the water and give the sharks a chance at
you, are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm going ashore," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that, Matt," counseled Glennie. "Why
is it necessary? If the valves are in shape, we can pull
out of here and make our way north under water. The
Japs will never be the wiser."</p>

<p>"I'm tired of bothering with these Sons of the Rising
Sun," Matt answered. "We never know what they're
going to do, or when they're going to do it. I thought
we had dropped them for good, down below English
Reach, but they were clever enough to get away from
Sandoval and play that trick in Lota. If possible, let's
put them out of the running, now, for keeps."</p>

<p>"How will you do it?" questioned Gaines.</p>

<p>"I'm not just sure of that, and won't be until I do a
little reconnoitring ashore. I've a scheme in mind, but
I want to be positive it will work before we try it. Go
down to the engine room, Gaines, and, Clackett, you
take your usual place in the tank room. Heave up the
anchor, Speake. Glennie, you get into the conning tower.
If the current sets inshore and causes the <i>Grampus</i> to
drift that way when the anchor is up, have the motor
run just enough to hold the boat where she is. Dick,
you hang on to the rifle. When you go down, Gaines,
pass up the strongest cable we have, so that Carl can
bend it on to the mooring ring at the stern. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I guess we all understand what we're to do," replied
Glennie, "but I'll be hanged if I know why we're to
do it."</p>

<p>"You'll know&mdash;perhaps sooner than you imagine."</p>

<p>Matt, stripped to his trousers, stepped to the landward
side of the boat.</p>

<p>"Sharks always go in pairs, mate," cautioned Dick.</p>

<p>"If you see one take after me, Dick," returned Matt,
"treat it the same as I did the one that took after you."</p>

<p>With hardly a splash Matt dropped into the water and
swam toward the beach.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A WARY FOE.</p>


<p>Matt reached the beach without mishap. Beyond the
white stretch of sand grew a chaparral of bushes and
low trees, covering the slope which ended at a ridge
forming the backbone of the point to the southward.</p>

<p>The young motorist took his way in this direction,
halting at the edge of the brush for a moment to turn
and give a reassuring wave to his comrades on the
<i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>Carl was just securing the end of a rope to the iron
ring at the stern of the boat, Glennie was half inside
the conning tower, and Dick had the rifle across his
knees. All three answered Matt's parting salute, and he
faced about and hurried into the chaparral.</p>

<p>Matt's course carried him up the side of the ridge.
Once at the crest he would be able to look down on the
Japs and take note of their operations. He would thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
be able to determine whether the bold scheme which he
had at the back of his brain would be feasible or not.</p>

<p>The crest of the ridge was not more than fifty feet
above sea level, and the king of the motor boys was
not long in reaching it. There, screened by a thicket
of bushes, he was able to look down on the other cove,
and make a leisurely examination of the <i>Pom</i> and the
Japs.</p>

<p>The <i>Pom</i>, as Dick had said, was lying within a short
distance of the shore. She was an odd-looking craft,
being of a much smaller diameter than the <i>Grampus</i>, and
having a flat deck built over the rounded plates of her
hull. The conning tower was only about half the height
and diameter of that of the <i>Grampus</i>, and seemed to have
a solid top without any hatch opening. The hatch was
forward, on the flat deck, and the cover was pushed
back.</p>

<p>From the submarine, Matt's eyes wandered to the
shelving beach.</p>

<p>The torpedo was there, rolled up beyond the reach
of the lapping waves, and two of the Japs were busy
about the conical end of the tube. Matt chuckled as he
thought of how he had tampered with the firing pin.
Before they could make the pin serviceable, the Japs
would have to rig another of the little propellers; and,
while their ingenuity was no doubt equal to the job, yet
it would take time to finish it.</p>

<p>The two men who were at work were clad only in
their trousers, and had clearly reached the shore as
Matt had done, by swimming. They went about their
work steadily and with an application which indicated
that they had little attention for anything else.</p>

<p>From their manner, it seemed a fair inference that the
rifle shot, or Dick's yell, from the other side of the
point, had failed to reach them.</p>

<p>But where were the other two Japs? Had they returned
to the <i>Pom</i>?</p>

<p>It might be that the two on the beach were in need
of more tools and had sent the others out to the boat after
them.</p>

<p>Matt, thinking of his plans, measured the distance
from the end of the point to the <i>Pom</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>Grampus</i> can do it!" he muttered, with an undernote
of exultation throbbing in his voice. "A quick
dash, and then a hustle seaward&mdash;and the trick is done.
But those other two Japs&mdash;I wish they would leave the
boat and come ashore. They form the danger point
in the carrying out of the scheme."</p>

<p>There was something else Matt noticed as he peered
out from behind his thicket, and that was that two rifles
lay on the sand within easy reach of the Jap mechanics.</p>

<p>"Those guns are another danger point," he said to
himself. "The <i>Pom</i>, however, will be between the <i>Grampus</i>
and the beach, and will act as a sort of barricade.
Anyhow, nothing venture, nothing win."</p>

<p>For five minutes longer Matt waited, watching for
the other two Japs to reappear through the <i>Pom's</i> hatch.
But they did not come, and he felt that he could wait
no longer.</p>

<p>Arising from his crouching position, he turned to retrace
his course down the hill. He had not taken a
dozen steps, however, when, dodging around a clump of
bushes, he came face to face with the two missing Japs!</p>

<p>From the actions of the two men, it was plain that
they were as much surprised as was Motor Matt.</p>

<p>The cause of this unexpected meeting flashed through
Matt's brain like lightning.</p>

<p>The rifle shot had been heard, and these two Japs
had been told to cross the ridge and investigate. Matt
had gained the shore before the Japs had cleared the
bushes and were able to see him. As they descended
the slope, he was going up, and fortune had decreed that
they give each other a wide berth. But fortune had
taken another tack, for she was now bringing Matt and
the Japs altogether too close to each other for comfort.</p>

<p>These Japs, like the two at work on the torpedo, were
stripped of all unnecessary clothing; and, fortunately for
the young motorist, they carried no weapons.</p>

<p>For an instant Matt and the two yellow men stared at
each other; then the Japs gave vent to a yell, and prepared
to keep Matt from continuing on down the hill.</p>

<p>Matt, remembering the two rifles he had seen on the
beach, had no intention of waiting for the other two
Japs to reach the scene. He saw the men before him
preparing to lay him by the heels in the most approved
ju-jutsu style, but that did not keep him back.</p>

<p>He leaped forward, apparently aiming to pass directly
between the two men. They jumped to get in his way,
whereupon he dodged to the right.</p>

<p>But, if he was quick, so were the Japs. No sooner
had he changed his course than they also had faced the
new direction.</p>

<p>As Matt went flying down the hill, one of them made
a dive for him. The king of the motor boys struck out
with his right fist&mdash;and he had a "right" about which
Carl Pretzel was wont to sing praises.</p>

<p>The fist accomplished its work, so far as that one
Jap was concerned. A sharp breath was jolted from the
yellow man and the hands he had put out dropped
limply, the while his whole body slumped backward.</p>

<p>But something happened to Matt, just what he had
not the least idea. All he knew was that he was lifted
high and sent crashing headfirst into a thicket of bushes.</p>

<p>The second Jap had put into practice one of the wrestling
tricks he had learned in Nippon.</p>

<p>Matt, however, was not sorry he had been thrown
in that unceremonious fashion, for, just as he dropped
into the bushes, the sodden <i>whang</i> of a rifle spoke from
the crest of the ridge and a bullet flew whining over the
very spot where he had been running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The other two Japs had lost little time in coming to
the aid of their comrades.</p>

<p>Matt was up almost as soon as he was down. His
superb physical training rendered him proof against any
such fall as that he had just received.</p>

<p>Both Japs were reaching for him as he ducked clear of
the bushes, but he slipped out from under their gripping
fingers and flashed down the slope like a streak, screening
his flight with every particle of tangled undergrowth
that got in his way.</p>

<p>The rifles behind him continued to cough and splutter.
The unarmed Japs, however, were between Matt
and the marksmen, and the care the latter had to use
sent their bullets wide.</p>

<p>The Japs were no match for Matt when it came to
sprinting. Matt had learned the game from a half-breed
friend, the best "miler" in Arizona, and he now showed
the Japs how an American boy can run when he has his
heart in it.</p>

<p>Before the yellow men had cleared the fringe of bushes
at the edge of the beach, Motor Matt was in the water;
and when the Japs emerged, Dick plowed up the ground
at their feet with bullets from the Marlin, and drove
them back.</p>

<p>Matt could not have swum faster if there had been a
whole school of sharks after him, but before he got to
the <i>Grampus</i> lead from the shore was pounding a merry
tattoo against the submarine's steel plates. Dick, exposing
himself recklessly, was answering with the Marlin.
Neither side was damaging the other, but the firing
spurred Matt to superhuman exertions.</p>

<p>When the young motorist reached the boat, Carl
ducked out from behind the conning tower and gave him
a hand up the slope of the deck.</p>

<p>"Now's the time," panted Matt, falling at full length
across the curved plates. "Start her&mdash;full speed."</p>

<p>"Where are we to go?" demanded Glennie.</p>

<p>"Around the point and take the <i>Pom</i> in tow," Matt
answered. "All four of the Japs are ashore, in this cove.
Before they can cross the ridge and interfere with us,
we ought to be able to pick up the other submarine and
make off with her. Look alive, now! We can't turn
the trick if you don't hustle."</p>

<p>The daring nature of Matt's scheme dawned on the
lads with something like a shock. And it appealed to
them, too! It was just such a scheme as they might have
expected Motor Matt to set going.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" jubilated Carl, as Glennie punched the
motor-room jingler. "Vat do you t'ink oof dot? Modor
Matt goes ashore mit himseluf und coaxes der Chaps to
shace him mit rifles, schust to ged dem oudt oof der vay
so ve can shteal pack der <i>Pom</i>. Vat a feller he iss!"</p>

<p>"You're giving me altogether too much credit, Carl,"
expostulated Matt. "I ran onto those Japs by accident,
and would have gone a good ways to keep clear of them."</p>

<p>"Vell, vat's der odds aboudt der tifference? Der
modor poys iss on dop und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A bullet from the shore slapped against the side of the
conning tower and whistled off into space, passing so
close to Carl's head in its flight that he stopped his glorying
and fell flat on the deck.</p>

<p>"They'll not stay long on the beach there when they
see where we're going," remarked Matt grimly.</p>

<p>"They've stopped their firing now, old ship," cried
Dick, "and are rushing back into the bushes as fast as
they can scramble."</p>

<p>"It has probably dawned upon them that we're planning
to run off with the <i>Pom</i>," said Matt. "Quick work,
now, and we'll win the day, and cut these Sons of the
Rising Sun out of our future calculations."</p>

<p>The propeller was churning the waters like mad, and
Glennie was laying a safe course to round the point and
bring the <i>Grampus</i> close to the <i>Pom</i>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PLUCK THAT WINS.</p>


<p>By the time that the <i>Grampus</i> got around the point
and was plunging onward, with "a bone in her teeth,"
straight for the <i>Pom</i>, Matt had recovered his breath and
was ready to play his part in the rest of the work.</p>

<p>"Make a circle around the stern of the <i>Pom</i>, Glennie,"
said Matt, peering shoreward to see if there were any
signs of the Japs coming down the south side of the
ridge. "That will give Dick a chance to jump to the
deck of the other craft."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Matt," replied Glennie.</p>

<p>"Give me the rifle, Dick," went on Matt, "and you
lay hold of the end of the rope Carl has secured to the
ring. As soon as you get on the other boat, make the
rope fast."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, matey!" cried Dick, elation ringing in his
voice and his eyes glimmering with excitement. "We'll
make a go of this, now that you have planned the scheme
and done the heft of the work in getting it started."</p>

<p>"There may still be a whole lot of trouble and hard
work between us and success. Let's not be too confident.
Ah," and Matt pointed toward the side of the
ridge, "there come the Japs. They're running even
faster than they did when they were after me. We're
going to have a tight squeak of it, Glennie, to double the
stern of the <i>Pom</i>, get Dick aboard and pull away with
our tow before the Japs get into the water."</p>

<p>"It's their guns I'm thinking of," said Glennie. "If
they happen to pick me out of the conning tower, or to
knock Dick off the deck of the <i>Pom</i>, the fat would all
be in the fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"They'll not do either of those things, matey," averred
Dick confidently. "It's our innings, now, and we're
bound to score."</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> raced on, and down the slope rushed
the Japs in a frantic endeavor to reach the water and
gain the <i>Pom</i> before the venturesome motor boys could
carry out their plans.</p>

<p>No shots were fired by the Japs. This seemed
strange, since a well-placed bullet would have meant so
much to them.</p>

<p>"What's the reason they're not tuning up, matey?"
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Dey hafen't got der time for dot," chuckled Carl.
"Dey're in too mooch oof of a hurry, py shinks."</p>

<p>"They could put a couple of bullets where they would
play hob with us," went on Dick, "and they must know
it."</p>

<p>"They do know it," said Matt. "There are four of
the Japs, and only two guns. I rather surmise that they
have used up all the ammunition in the magazines of the
rifles, and that their reserve supply is on the <i>Pom</i>."</p>

<p>Just at that moment Glennie swerved the <i>Grampus</i> to
pass between the stern of the <i>Pom</i> and the shore.</p>

<p>"Ready, Dick!" warned Matt.</p>

<p>"Right-o," answered Dick, seizing one end of the
cable and balancing himself on the port side of the
<i>Grampus</i>. "Swing her as close as you can, Glennie,"
he added to the ensign.</p>

<p>Supporting himself by clinging to a wire guy with
one hand, Dick waited. Glennie signaled the engine
room for slower speed, and the <i>Grampus</i> rounded neatly
and pushed her nose past the tower of the other boat.</p>

<p>"There you are, Dick!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>The next instant Dick had leaped across the intervening
stretch of water and had landed on the flat deck
of the <i>Pom</i>.</p>

<p>Before his feet had struck the deck, however, Matt
saw a Jap's head and shoulders push upward through
the <i>Pom's</i> hatch. If there had been time to feel anything
so useless as surprise, Matt would certainly have
been taken all aback.</p>

<p>Captain Pons had said that only five Japs had comprised
the crew which had palmed themselves off as
Chilians. One of these five had been left in Lota, a
prisoner. According to Matt's reckoning, that left only
four of the yellow men in charge of the <i>Pom</i>. Where,
then, did this extra Jap come in?</p>

<p>Matt did not pause to let this drift through his mind.
Making a short run across the <i>Grampus</i>, he flung himself
after Dick, reaching the flat deck of the other submarine
and only saving himself a fall over the opposite
side of the craft by dropping to his knees.</p>

<p>Hardly had he landed when a pair of heavy feet
clanged down behind him and a form collided roughly
with his back. Once more Matt came within a hair's
breadth of dropping off the port side of the <i>Pom</i>.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," puffed a choppy voice, "you don'd vas
going to leaf me pehindt! Dere iss more Chaps on dis
poat as we knowed aboudt, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl's sentence was never finished. The Jap Matt had
seen in the open hatch had gained the deck and had
rushed at Carl like a whirlwind. Another showed himself,
following close upon the heels of the first.</p>

<p>"Make the rope fast, Dick!" roared Matt. "Carl and
I will look after these fellows."</p>

<p>Dick went down on his knees and began securing the
rope. It was necessary to make it fast before the slack
was all taken up, otherwise the tow line would have been
jerked out of Dick's hands and the work would have
had to be done all over again.</p>

<p>Matt caught the second Jap about the waist as he
crawled through the hatch. There was a brief struggle,
and it ended by Matt heaving the Jap over the side and
into the water. The other Jap had performed a like
service for Carl, and the Dutch boy, blowing like a porpoise,
was floating around in the bay, trying to get hold
of something and pull himself back on the deck.</p>

<p>The Jap started at once for Matt. Before he reached
him, Dick, who had made fast the line, rushed him from
the rear and literally bore him off the boat. He dropped
into the water alongside his comrade.</p>

<p>"Help Carl aboard, Dick!" called Matt.</p>

<p>Dick bent over and gave Carl a hand. Just at that
moment the boat leaped forward under the sudden pull
of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>But here, just as victory was all but ranged on the
side of the motor boys, the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps Glennie was to blame. It would have been
better if he had slowed the <i>Grampus</i> down almost to a
stop and then picked up the strain on the tow line with
a steady pull.</p>

<p>It was useless, however, to find fault with anybody.
The thing happened, and that was all there was to it.</p>

<p>The tow line snapped. One end of it jerked back and
caught Matt a tremendous blow on the temple, and he
dropped as though from the impact of a heavy fist.</p>

<p>A howl of consternation broke from Carl.</p>

<p>"Id's all oop mit us!" he shouted. "Der rope iss
pusted in der mittle, Matt is down, und der Chaps iss all
aroundt us!"</p>

<p>Carl's quick eyes had sized up the situation correctly.
The four Japs who had crossed the ridge from the other
cove had reached the water and were swimming to the
<i>Pom</i>. The two who had been forced overboard by Matt
and his chums were paddling about and making frantic
efforts to regain the deck.</p>

<p>Dick had not much time to think of what they should
do. With Matt down, could he and Carl successfully
beat off the six yellow men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick flung a despairing glance after the <i>Grampus</i>.
Glennie, wild with anxiety over the outcome of what
seemed a certain <i>fiasco</i>, was ringing all kinds of signals
in the motor room, and, for once in his life, seemed
completely "rattled" and at a loss as to what move he
should make.</p>

<p>At that moment an idea darted into Dick's brain.</p>

<p>"Keep away, Glennie!" Dick yelled, waving his hands.
"Sheer off to a good distance, and wait! Carl," and he
whirled on the Dutch boy with fierce determination,
"we'll take Matt below. We can close ourselves inside
the steel shell and the Japs won't be able to get at us."</p>

<p>"Meppy dere's more Chaps in der poat!" demurred
Carl.</p>

<p>"No!" thundered Dick. "Do you suppose they'd stay
below while this scrimmage was going on over their
heads? Down the hatch with you, and take Matt as I
lower him!"</p>

<p>Carl saw that there was nothing else for it, and made
haste to carry out his orders. The floor was less than
five feet under the deck, and Carl was able to stand
erect and take Matt in his arms as Dick let him down.
The Japs were gaining the deck from all sides as Dick
followed, and the hatch cover was banged shut and made
fast just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" muttered Carl, listening to the patter
of bare feet on the plates overhead. "Vat a fix iss dis.
Der Chaps haf got us, und dey ain'd got us; und ve haf
got dem in der same vay. Ve can't ged oudt, und dey
can't ged in. Vat's der answer?"</p>

<p>"A little light, first," said Dick coolly. "Don't let the
Japs worry you&mdash;there's a stout steel armor between us
and them. It's as black as a pocket in here, now that
the hatch is closed. Have you got a match?"</p>

<p>It took Carl several moments to dig a match out of his
blouse. He had one, just one, and it was a wonder he
had even that. No one had any use for matches aboard
the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>Carl drew the match along the steel floor. As the
flickering gleam grew stronger, he and Dick took in the
dimensions of that part of their prison.</p>

<p>The floor apparently divided the interior of the steel
hull in half, the rounded plates of the hull meeting it on
both sides. A bulkhead cut off the view aft.</p>

<p>"You rub Matt's forehead and hands and see if you
can't fetch him to," said Dick. "I'm going aft to see
what's on the other side of that bulkhead."</p>

<p>"Der match iss gone!" muttered Carl, dropping the
charred stick.</p>

<p>"I've located the bulkhead door, so it doesn't much
matter," answered Dick.</p>

<p>The opening of the door brought in a little daylight.
The door led out under the conning tower, and the light
came through the tower lunettes.</p>

<p>Dick, straightening up, shoved his head and shoulders
into the tower. On all sides Jap eyes were glaring in
at him.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" he muttered, and dropped down again.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A LITTLE WORK ON THE INSIDE.</p>


<p>When Matt drifted back to consciousness, his head lay
on Carl's knee. Carl and Dick had dragged him out under
the conning tower, where the light was better.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" were Matt's first words.</p>

<p>"In the <i>Pom</i>, matey," was Dick's grim response.</p>

<p>"Ve can't ged oudt, eider, Matt," croaked Carl gloomily,
"und der Chaps can't ged in. Vich vould you radder
be, der Chaps or us?"</p>

<p>Matt sat up, rubbing his head.</p>

<p>"I remember now," he murmured. "The tow line
broke, and the <i>Pom</i> end of it sprang back and hit me
on the forehead. You brought me below?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of anything else to do, matey," said
Dick. "We were surrounded by six Japs, and I thought
it better to take our chances inside. We got below and
closed the hatch just in time. Listen! You can hear the
Japs walking around on deck. If you get up in the tower
you can see them looking in at the lunettes! But it's
not pleasant. The straightened eyes of those swabs are
pretty savage. I wouldn't give tuppence for our chances
if they could get at us. And they may find out a way
to come in here. If you can think of anything to do that
will help us out of this hole, Matt, please be in a hurry
about it."</p>

<p>"Yah," put in Carl, "don'd vaste any time."</p>

<p>"Where's the <i>Grampus</i>?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>His head bothered him, but there was no time to think
of physical troubles of that sort.</p>

<p>"I told Glennie to keep her away. There wasn't anything
he could do by running close, anyhow. The Japs
would have boarded the <i>Grampus</i>, if he had come too
close, and there would be only four on our boat to stand
off the six Japs."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," remarked Matt, looking around, "this
might be worse."</p>

<p>"How?" moaned Carl. "I don'd see dot."</p>

<p>Matt's interest in the <i>Pom</i>, now that he was able to
give the boat a personal examination, bade fair to eclipse
his concern for the dangers by which he was surrounded.
Here was a brand-new piece of mechanism, a boat
crammed with French machinery that would well repay
a close study.</p>

<p>A rigid box under the conning tower, enabled a man
to lift the upper half of his body into the cupola and
get his eyes opposite the lunettes. As the man stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
there, his right hand fell naturally on a steering wheel
and his left on push buttons which must communicate
with the engine room.</p>

<p>"This is a whole lot different from the interior of the
<i>Grampus</i>," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"Id is so shmall as a rat drap," shuddered Carl. "I
feel like I vas shut oop in a cage."</p>

<p>Matt, pushing backward from the turret, fell off a
ledge into a sort of well. As he sat up and groped
about with his hands, he touched a switch. Pulling the
switch, an incandescent lamp flared out overhead.</p>

<p>"That's better," said he. "Now we can look around
without so much trouble."</p>

<p>Here, aft from the conning tower, machinery was
packed away closely.</p>

<p>Up against the roof, on the port side, was a little
engine, operated by compressed air, by which the submarine
was steered. Matt discovered that by observing
the wires that ran to the engine from the steering wheel.</p>

<p>On the starboard side, likewise against the roof, was
another engine, with disks at each end as large as dinner
plates.</p>

<p>"H'm," mused Matt, trying to rub the ache out of his
head so his brain would be clearer, "those disks are diaphragms,
and must be connected, in some way, with the
water pressure. I have it!" and a triumphant look
crossed his face, "this is the diving engine, and that
wheel"&mdash;he touched the wheel as he spoke&mdash;"controls
it."</p>

<p>At one side was a cubic steel box.</p>

<p>"Air compressor," said Matt, touching the box.</p>

<p>On the floor, just where Matt had dropped into the
well, were two levers. Matt lifted one of them. Instantly
there came a gurgle and splash of water, directly
under Carl and Dick.</p>

<p>"Avast, matey!" cried Dick. "I wouldn't fool with
those things until you know more about them."</p>

<p>Muffled cries came from the Japs outside.</p>

<p>"They hear what's going on," laughed Matt, "and
they don't like it. We're filling the submerging tanks,
Dick," he explained.</p>

<p>"Then why don't we sink?"</p>

<p>"It takes the engine to help us sink&mdash;the diving engine
and the motor."</p>

<p>Farther back beyond the well was the engine room.</p>

<p>"Here's where I'm at home," said Matt, creeping into
the engine room and turning on another incandescent
light.</p>

<p>In one side were switchboards for the dynamotors,
and near them were spiral resistance coils curving along
the roof. Over on the other side was a trolley controller,
which Matt knew must be used for speeding the vessel
under water.</p>

<p>"Give the wheel of that diving engine a turn to the
right, Dick," called Matt.</p>

<p>Dick obeyed the order. Matt turned the switch of the
controller and then instantly there was a low, electrical
hum and the <i>Pom</i> started toward the bottom.</p>

<p>"Get on the box under the conning tower, Dick," said
Matt, "and do the steering."</p>

<p>"How'll I steer? There's no periscope."</p>

<p>"Steer by compass&mdash;there's one right in front of you
as you stand in the tower."</p>

<p>"But what'll I do for light? We're under water and
no daylight comes in at the lunettes."</p>

<p>Matt touched a switch, and electric light flooded the
tower.</p>

<p>"I don't like this tinkering, I'm a Fiji if I do," muttered
Dick, as he crawled up into the tower.</p>

<p>"We've got rid of the Japs by the tinkering, Dick,"
said Matt. "They're swimming ashore by now."</p>

<p>"What I'm afraid of is," went on Dick, "you'll get us
on the bottom and not be able to take us to the surface
again."</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you. If we want to go to the
surface, all we have to do is to twist the diving rudders
and empty the tanks."</p>

<p>"What's the course, matey?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"West by north until we clear the point, then north."</p>

<p>"How am I to know when we clear the point?"</p>

<p>"Why, we'll go to the surface and take a look. Glennie
will probably be glad to have a sight of us before
long."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he's worrying his head off! The quicker we
can go up, Matt, the better."</p>

<p>"All right. Carl!"</p>

<p>"On der chump!" answered the Dutch boy.</p>

<p>"Give the wheel of the diving engine a turn to the
left&mdash;to the <i>left</i>, mind."</p>

<p>"Dere she goes."</p>

<p>Instantly there was a perceptible movement upward.</p>

<p>"Now," went on Matt, "lift that other lever on the
floor near you&mdash;the one I didn't lift, if you can remember."</p>

<p>Carl lifted the lever, and, by chance, the right one. A
hiss of compressed air was heard, followed by a splash
of water being forced from the ballast tanks. The <i>Pom</i>
jumped for the surface like a streak.</p>

<p>"Daylight at the lunettes!" shouted Dick, overjoyed
to make sure that Matt really knew what he was about.
"All you've got to do to know all about a piece of machinery,
Matt," he added, "is just to look at it."</p>

<p>"And use my head," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," boomed Carl, "you can do more mit a
cracked head dan any odder feller can do mit vone dot's
all ridght. Yah, so helup me. You know more aboudt
machinery in a year as anypody else does in a minid."</p>

<p>"See anything of the Japs, Dick?" inquired Matt, stopping
the electric motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a sign!" exulted Dick. "But there's the old
<i>Grampus</i>, with Speake on deck and Glennie half out of
the tower. Their eyes are this way, and you'd think,
from their faces, they're looking at a ghost."</p>

<p>"Dey can't oondershtand how ve got oudt oof dot
schrape," said Carl. "Ve hat some pooty pad brospects,
for a vile, you bed you."</p>

<p>"Holy smoke!" exclaimed Dick, almost falling off the
box he was standing on.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's our old friend, the cruiser <i>Salvadore</i>,
with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash; 'Pon my soul, Matt, I'm a Fiji if that
Captain Pons isn't on the bridge with Captain Sandoval!"</p>

<p>This was amazing news.</p>

<p>"The war ship must have just got here, then," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"But how did she know where we were?"</p>

<p>"Probably she spoke the <i>Sovereign</i>," Matt answered.
"That would have given Sandoval a pretty good clue."</p>

<p>"Oh, strike me lucky! The <i>Salvadore</i> is turning
broadside on, and some of her crew are manning the
small guns&mdash;the rapid-fire guns. They're going to blow
us out of water, Matt!"</p>

<p>"Hardly that, Dick," said Matt easily. "Sandoval
isn't going to destroy this submarine. Pons wouldn't let
him, even if he had such a notion. If anything happened
to the boat, Pons wouldn't be able to deliver her to the
Chilian government."</p>

<p>"They're mighty warlike, anyway," went on Dick.
"And there's Glennie, on the <i>Grampus</i>, trying his best to
attract the attention of Sandoval."</p>

<p>"Sandoval and Pons think the <i>Pom</i> is full of Japs,"
laughed Matt. "We'd better go up and clear the fog out
of their brains. It will be a pleasure to meet Captain
Sandoval again. He's a good friend of ours, you know."</p>

<p>"Meppy dot vas a lucky t'ing," vouchsafed Carl, "seeing
as how Pons iss madt pecause ve vouldn't go afder
der <i>Pom</i> mit der <i>Grampus</i>."</p>

<p>"That's just what we did, though, although we didn't
intend making any such move. We shall now have the
pleasure of turning the <i>Pom</i> over to Captain Pons."</p>

<p>Making their way through the bulkhead door, Matt,
Dick, and Carl gained the hatch, threw it open, and
crawled out on the submarine's deck.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="chaptitle">A STAR PERFORMANCE.</p>


<p>The <i>Pom</i> was lying between the <i>Grampus</i> and the <i>Salvadore</i>.
When Matt, Dick, and Carl showed themselves
there were loud cheers from Glennie and Speake. Pons,
on the bridge of the war ship, could be seen jumping
up and down like a pea on a hot griddle, waving his
hands and yelling. The war ship was too far away for
the boys to hear what Pons said.</p>

<p>"I'd about given you fellows up!" exclaimed Glennie.
"When that confounded tow line parted, my hopes parted
with it. We saw you sink and throw the Japs into the
water, and we were sure you'd gone down to stay."</p>

<p>"The Japs got ashore, did they?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Every last one of them."</p>

<p>"Well, Glennie, come along here and take us off. I
want to go to the war ship and make a report to Captain
Sandoval."</p>

<p>Glennie brought the <i>Grampus</i> close to the French boat,
and the three boys transferred themselves to their own
craft.</p>

<p>"I vouldn't trade vone oof der <i>Grampuses</i> for a tozen
of der <i>Poms</i>," asserted Carl, as they were borne away
in the direction of the <i>Salvadore</i>.</p>

<p>"I don't know how seven Japs ever stowed themselves
away inside the <i>Pom</i>," muttered Dick. "They must have
been packed in there like sardines."</p>

<p>"They managed to do a pretty fair amount of work,
too," said Matt. "Not the least of it was lassoing me
and pulling me into the water."</p>

<p>As the <i>Grampus</i> approached the war ship, Captain
Sandoval leaned from the bridge with his megaphone.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt, king of the motor boys!" he shouted.
"Ah, ha, <i>amigo</i>, you are as full of surprises as the egg
is of meat."</p>

<p>Captain Pons failed to join Captain Sandoval in his
amiable sentiment. Pons shook his fist.</p>

<p>"R-r-rascal!" he shouted. "He is mos' contemptible!"</p>

<p>"Throw over your sea ladder, captain," called Matt;
"I want to come aboard and talk with you."</p>

<p>"<i>Gracias!</i>" cried Sandoval. "I am delighted, <i>amigo</i>."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Matt was in the captain's cabin.
He had been there once before, but not under circumstances
that were very pleasant. On the previous occasion,
Captain Sandoval had been hostile and full of unjust
suspicions. Now he was more than friendly, and it
was Captain Pons who was hostile.</p>

<p>"You heard how those rascally Japs gave me the slip,
<i>amigo</i>?" asked Sandoval. "Ah, ah, what a wretched
piece of business! It was in a fog, and one could not
see his hand in front of his face. Thus they escaped.
<i>Ay de mi</i>, it was a blow! I came north looking for the
rascals, and I reached Lota last night and found Pons.
He told me of the troubles he has been having with the
Japs, and since it was my duty to aid him in recovering
the <i>Pom</i>, why, I took him aboard and we started north.
The British vessel Sovereign gave us a tip, and we followed
it to this bay. First, we saw the <i>Grampus</i>; then,
all so suddenly, up out of the ocean came the <i>Pom</i>!
I trained my guns on her to fire in case the Japs proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
unreasonable. Presently, behold, the hatch of the <i>Pom</i>
opens and you appear. Wonderful! I can hardly believe
my eyes because of the so great surprise!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my captain," broke in Pons, "zis Matt is ze r-ruf-fian,
ze villain. He say he no haf ze time to bozzer wiz
my little boat, zat he not go hunt for her; now, by gar,
we see heem on her deck. He play ze trick wiz me. He
do w'at he say he not do. He try steal ze boat, <i>oui</i>,
zat is w'at he do. I demand of heem ze satisfaction!"</p>

<p>The captain's eyes became very fierce and he threw
back his shoulders and slapped his chest.</p>

<p>"Ah, my captain," said Sandoval, "don't make a mistake.
I know Motor Matt, and he is a gentleman. I
have given him my hand, my captain, and Captain Sandoval
never gives his hand to a scoundrel."</p>

<p>Captain Pons arose with much dignity and bowed to
Captain Sandoval.</p>

<p>"<i>Merci, monsieur!</i>" he murmured. "Nevair vill I say
ze derogatory word to youar honor, but ze actions of zis
Motor Matt, w'at you call, is mos' contemptible. Let
heem spik, let heem explain if he can."</p>

<p>"<i>Amigo</i>," said Captain Sandoval, "you will explain, for
my sake, to my honorable friend, Captain Pons?"</p>

<p>"That's what I came here to do," answered Matt. "I
and my friends have saved the <i>Pom</i> for Captain Pons,
and this is the reward he gives us."</p>

<p>Captain Pons got up and bowed again to Captain
Sandoval. Not to be outdone in courtesy, Captain Sandoval
arose and bowed to Captain Pons.</p>

<p>"If I do heem ze wrong," said Captain Pons gravely,
"zen I make ze <i>amende</i>. Until he explains, I have ze
right to call him mos' contemptible."</p>

<p>"You have the right," agreed Captain Sandoval.</p>

<p>Then they bowed again and sat down.</p>

<p>All this was highly edifying to Matt, but it did not
get him very far along with his explanation.</p>

<p>When he got started, however, he held the floor in
spite of disturbing symptoms on the part of Pons to get
up and bow. He carried the explanation through to its
conclusion, and not failing to put due stress on the dangers
he and his friends had undergone in their attempt to
get the better of the Sons of the Rising Sun.</p>

<p>The two captains were deeply impressed. For some
moments after Matt had finished they sat speechless in
their chairs; then, as one man they arose. Together they
bowed to Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Ay de mi</i>," breathed Captain Sandoval, "did you ever
hear of anything so wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Mos' r-r-remarkable!" exclaimed Captain Pons.</p>

<p>Then they bent to each other. After that Captain
Sandoval sat down, but Captain Pons stepped over to
Matt and embraced him; then, before Matt could defend
himself, Captain Pons kissed him on the cheek.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon ami!</i>" said he; "my friend, I mak' ze apologee.
I ask zat you forgeeve ze talk about you as ze mos' contemptible.
It is I, me, zat is mos' contemptible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, my captain," protested Captain Sandoval,
putting up his hand, "you shall not so greatly injure
yourself."</p>

<p>"I r-r-repeat," thundered Captain Pons, thumping his
chest fiercely, "I made ze mistake, and I, myself, am mos'
contemptible."</p>

<p>Captain Sandoval sighed and looked depressed.</p>

<p>"Zis brav' young man," proceeded Captain Pons, "save
ze <i>Pom</i> for me. I sank heem, as one gentleman sank
anozzer. Zere, ze debt is cancel. All zat remain is for
me to hol' him in mos' tender memory."</p>

<p>"The six Japanese are on the island, Captain Sandoval,"
said Matt, who was beginning to get a little bit
tired of Pons and his mushy nonsense. "Will you send
a party ashore to capture them?"</p>

<p>"At once," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And, by the way, Captain Pons," went on Matt,
"didn't you say there were only five Japs in the crew
that stole the <i>Pom</i>."</p>

<p>"Fife, <i>oui</i>. I count zem and I know."</p>

<p>"Well, that one we captured under the wharf, at Lota,
comes out of the five, and would leave four."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, wan from fife is four."</p>

<p>"Then, captain, how do you account for the fact that
there were six on the <i>Pom</i> when she reached this bay?"</p>

<p>"Do you say I spik untruths?" flared the captain,
displaying a tendency to renew his quarrel with Matt.</p>

<p>"Not at all, not for the world," answered Matt, with
an inward laugh, "but I am puzzled. One from five,
in this case, seems to have left six."</p>

<p>"I know nozzing, sare," said Captain Pons. "If zere
was seex w'en zere should only haf been fife, zat is zeir
business."</p>

<p>"Then we'll let it stand that way," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I am mos' agreeable," returned Captain Pons. "Presently,
my captain," he went on, to Sandoval, "I go
aboard ze <i>Pom</i> wiz ze crew you gif me, an' we take ze
boat to Valparaiso. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my captain," replied Sandoval. "I will lend you
the crew and will convoy you to Valparaiso."</p>

<p>"You are mos' kind."</p>

<p>This was enough for Matt. He excused himself, shook
hands with Sandoval, and hurried away.</p>

<p>As soon as he was safely in the periscope room of the
<i>Grampus</i>, he threw himself down on the locker and
laughed until he was sore.</p>

<p>"Get me the rest of my clothes, somebody," said he,
"and then start the <i>Grampus</i> northward again."</p>

<p>"Where's our next port of call, old ship?" queried
Dick, while Matt was getting into the garments he had
taken off just before swimming ashore in the cove.</p>

<p>"Callao," answered Matt. "Then Panama, Acapulco,
San Diego&mdash;and Frisco."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dot lisdens like home!" rumbled Carl.</p>

<p>"In two weeks," cried Glennie, "we'll be at Mare Island,
and the cruise will be finished. It's all plain sailing
from this on. The Sons of the Rising Sun will have
all they can do to take care of themselves, let alone try
to make any more trouble for us."</p>

<p>"We're done with them, and there are no ifs or ands
about it this time," said Matt. "I'll admit, when I
learned they had made off with that French submarine,
that I thought they were equipped to accomplish something
against us; but we cleared that difficulty in one-two
order when we got started."</p>

<p>"It might have been a lot worse, mates," observed
Dick, "and there were several times when I thought we
were done, done as brown as a kippered herring; but we
pulled through&mdash;mainly because Matt had his shoulder
to the wheel and gave us the right sort of a boost over
the hard places."</p>

<p>"As much credit should fall to the rest of you as to
me," spoke up Matt. "Take the wheel, Glennie. Full
speed ahead, Gaines," he added, through the motor-room
tube.</p>

<p>The cylinders never hummed a cheerier tune than
they did when they started the <i>Grampus</i> once more on
her journey northward, and no boat, surface or submarine,
ever carried a happier crew.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>As day followed day and week followed week, bringing
no sign of any further trouble with the Sons of the
Rising Sun, Motor Matt and his friends realized that,
beyond all doubt, they had worsted their wily foes, and
perhaps had taught them a lesson which they could ponder
wisely.</p>

<p>At Panama, which was almost the same as United
States soil, the boys took shore leave, turn and turn
about. From this place Matt sent a cablegram to Captain
Nemo, Jr., at Belize.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the last leg of our journey. All well and
<i>Grampus</i> as fit as a fiddle. Telegraph me at Acapulco."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Too bad that old canal wasn't finished," observed
Dick, as the <i>Grampus</i> left Panama, "at the time we left
Belize. We could have come through it, if it had been,
and saved a month's time and all that mix-up with the
Japs."</p>

<p>"That wasn't the point, Dick," spoke up Glennie.
"This trip has been in the nature of a try-out for the
<i>Grampus</i>. The government wanted to see what she could
do&mdash;and I guess the government will know when my log
is read at headquarters."</p>

<p>"You're giving us a good report, Glennie?" laughed
Dick.</p>

<p>"As good as I can make it."</p>

<p>"Then that means a sale of the boat, without a doubt."</p>

<p>"I understood that my report was to be final. I've
had the cruise of my life with you motor boys, and I
almost hate to reach San Francisco, because we'll have
to separate there."</p>

<p>"You're an A One comrade, Glennie," said Matt heartily,
"and you need never look for a pal while this outfit
of motor boys is around."</p>

<p>"My sentiments to a t, y, ty," averred Dick.</p>

<p>"Und mine, too, py shinks!" cried Carl.</p>

<p>Glennie was deeply touched. At the beginning of the
cruise there had been some hard feelings between him
and Dick and Carl, but as they had come to know each
other better the unpleasantness had worn away.</p>

<p>All four of the lads were now loyal friends, having
undergone perils and dangers shoulder to shoulder, and
so each had tried the other's and had not found them
wanting.</p>

<p>At Acapulco Matt was confidently expecting to receive
a message from Captain Nemo, Jr. In this, however, he
was disappointed. There was no message for him. Matt
could not understand the reason and was prone to think
dire things.</p>

<p>"Captain Nemo, Jr., would surely have answered that
message I sent him from Panama," said Matt, "providing
he had received it."</p>

<p>"Sure he would," agreed Glennie; "and the fact that
you did not get an answer is proof that the captain did
not receive your message."</p>

<p>"Aber vy ditn't he receif id?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"That's the point that alarms me, friends," went on
Matt gloomily. "You know we left the captain sick at
Belize; too ill, in fact, to come with us on the <i>Grampus</i>.
We haven't heard a word from him since the cruise
began, and it may be that his sickness terminated
fatally."</p>

<p>This thought cast a depression over the motor boys.
Captain Nemo, Jr., was a good friend of theirs, and all
of them liked him. The <i>Grampus</i> was the triumph of
the captain's career, and if he was to be stricken down
just as the boat, in charge of the motor boys, was to
pass successfully through the Golden Gate, the elation
Matt and his friends would otherwise feel must give
way to dejection and sorrow.</p>

<p>The victory of this successful cruise was entirely
theirs, but the loss of Captain Nemo, Jr., would rob the
victory of all pleasure for them.</p>

<p>But the gloom that accompanied the submarine from
Acapulco northward was lost in rejoicing at San Diego;
for no sooner had the <i>Grampus</i> anchored in the bay off
the latter place than no less a person than Captain Nemo,
Jr., himself, rowed out and came aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain was well and hearty, and his delight in
welcoming the boys was boundless.</p>

<p>He looked over the boat and complimented all hands
on her efficiency after such a long cruise&mdash;the longest
and hardest any submarine had ever made; and in the
periscope room, until long into the night, the captain sat
wide-eyed and absorbed, listening to the adventures of
those whom he had commissioned to take the <i>Grampus</i>
from Belize to Mare Island.</p>

<p>When all had had their say, and the recital was done,
there followed a period of silence. The captain was the
first to speak.</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand dollars, my lads, is a great deal
of money; but if I had been able to look ahead and
learn what dangers were to beset you on your long journey,
I would not have allowed you to start for a million.
I had some inkling of this Japanese business, for I was
offered two hundred thousand for the <i>Grampus</i> by the
Japanese government. I chose to deal with the navy department
of my own country, even at a direct pecuniary
loss to myself. My refusal to sell to the Japs brought
a threatening letter from the Sons of the Rising Sun,
but I treated it with contempt. I should have taken you
into my confidence regarding this Japanese matter before
you left Belize, but I thought it of no moment and hesitated
to alarm you by even mentioning it."</p>

<p>"It's all but over now, captain," laughed Matt lightly,
"and I think we are all of us better for the experience.
I know I wouldn't sell the benefit that has accrued to
me from this cruise for a lot of money."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Me, neider," chirped Carl.</p>

<p>"Let me go on record, too," put in Glennie.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you all feel in that way about it," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"By the way," asked Matt, "why didn't you answer
the cablegram I sent you from Panama, captain?"</p>

<p>"Principally because I never received it," was the smiling
response. "Where did you address the message,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"To you, at Belize."</p>

<p>"Why, I left Belize a week after you did! It was
my intention all along to leave Central America, work up
into the States, and then meet you here and take the last
lap of the cruise with you."</p>

<p>"It was a mighty big relief to see you come aboard at
this port," said Matt. "I hadn't the least idea what was
the matter."</p>

<p>"You had a guess that I had taken the One-way Trail,
hadn't you, Matt?" jested the captain.</p>

<p>"I didn't know but that might have happened."</p>

<p>"In that event," said the captain, "I had already made
a will whereby you boys were to receive the whole
amount to be paid by the government. So, you see, my
being alive has cost you a pretty pile."</p>

<p>"The money doesn't count, captain," declared Matt
stoutly.</p>

<p>"No? Well, money usually counts in this world, Matt&mdash;in
fact, it cuts a pretty wide swath in every direction."</p>

<p>"It is secondary, captain, to the idea of 'making good.'
When we left Belize I vowed that we'd make good and
prove that your confidence in us wasn't misplaced.
We've all had that in mind before anything and everything
else."</p>

<p>"It's a good trait in you," replied the captain, "and in
any young man, to love a piece of work for itself, and,
money apart, centre every hope on making a success of
it. That's the spirit that brings its reward, not only in
money, but in self-approval, which is something money
can't buy. Every one who went around South America
on the <i>Grampus</i> will find, I think, that I know how to be
grateful; this, while of secondary importance to the consciousness
of duty well performed, will be a substantial
acknowledgment of the debt I hold myself under to all
of you.</p>

<p>"In San Francisco the <i>Grampus</i> will be sold. The
motor boys will go one way, Captain Nemo, Jr., another
way, and Speake, Gaines, and Clackett still another. But
I hope that this will not be the last of our associations,
but that we shall sometime come together again and
renew our friendships, which have been so firmly woven
together by this cruise of the <i>Grampus</i>, and the persistent
and successful effort of the king of the motor boys to
<i>make good</i>."</p>

<p>With the hearty echoes this sentiment received still
lingering in our ears, the hour seems propitious for taking
leave of Matt and the motor boys, while they are at
the threshold of another of their many victories.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">II.</p>

<p>On the 30th there was trouble beyond Wild Hat, and all
our extra men, put out there under Healey, were fighting to
Hold the Rat Valley levels where they hug the river on the
west slope. It wasn't really Healey's track. Bucks sent him
over there just as the emperor sent Ney, wherever he needed
his right arm. Sunday, while Healey was at Wild Hat, rain
began falling. Sunday it rained; Monday all through the
mountains it rained; Tuesday it was raining from Omaha
to Eagle Pass, with the thermometer climbing for breath
and the barometer flat as an adder&mdash;and the Spider woke.
Woke with the April water and the June water and the storm
water all at once.</p>

<p>Trackwalkers Tuesday night flagged Number One, and reported
the Spider wild, with heavy sheet ice running. A wire
from Bucks brought Healey out of the west and into the
east, and brought him to reckon for the last time with his
ancient enemy.</p>

<p>He was against it Wednesday with dynamite. All the day,
all the night, all the next day the sullen roar of the giant
powder shook the forming jam above the bridge, and after
two days Healey wired, "Ice out," and set back without a
minute's sleep for home. Saturday night he slept and Sunday
all day and Sunday night. Monday about noon Bucks
sent up to ask, but Healey still slept. They asked back by
the lad whether they should wake him. Bucks sent word,
"No."</p>

<p>It was late Tuesday morning when the tall roadmaster
came down, and he was fresh as sunshine. All day he sat
with Bucks and the dispatchers watching the line. The
Spider raced mad, and the watchers sent in panic messages,
but Healey put them in his pipe. "That bridge will go
when the mountains go," was all he said.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock that night every star was blinking when
Healey looked in for the trackwalkers' reports and the railroad
weather bulletins. Bucks, Callahan, and Peeto sat
about Martin Duffy, the dispatcher, who in his shirt sleeves
threw the stuff off the sounder as it trickled in dot and dash,
dot and dash over the wires.</p>

<p>The west wire was good; east everything below Peace
River was down. We had to get the eastern reports around
by Omaha and the south&mdash;a good thousand miles of a loop&mdash;but
bad news travels even around a Robin Hood loop.</p>

<p>And first came Wild Hat from the west with a stationary
river and the Loup Creek falling&mdash;clear&mdash;good night. And
Ed Peeto struck the table heavily and swore it was well in
the west. Then from the east came Prairie Portage, all the
way round, with a northwest rain, a rising river, and anchor
ice running, pounding the piers bad&mdash;track in fair shape, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The wire went wrong. As Duffy knit his eyes and tugged
and cussed a little, the wind outside took up the message and
whirled a bucket of rain against the windows. But the wires
wouldn't right, and stuff that no man could get tumbled
in like a dictionary upside down. And Bucks and Callahan
and Healey and Peeto smoked, silent, and heard the deepening
drum of the rain on the roof.</p>

<p>Then Duffy wrestled mightily yet once more.</p>

<p>"Keep still," he exclaimed, leaning heavily on the key.
"Here's something&mdash;from the Spider."</p>

<p>He snatched a pen and ran it across a clip; Bucks leaning
over read aloud from his shoulder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"Omaha.</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">J. F. Bucks</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"Trainmen from No. 75 stalled west of Rapid City&mdash;track
afloat in Simpson's Cut&mdash;report Spider bridge out&mdash;send&mdash;&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>And the current broke.</p>

<p>Callahan's hand closed rigidly over the hot bowl of his
pipe; Peeto sat speechless; Bucks read again at the broken
message, but Healey sprang like a man wounded and snatched
the clip from his hand.</p>

<p>He stared at the running words till they burned his eyes,
and then, with an oath, frightful as the thunder that shook
the mountains, he dashed the clip to the floor. His eyes
snapped greenish, and he cursed Omaha, cursed its messages,
and everything that came out of it. Slow at first, then
fast and faster, until all the sting that poisoned his heart
in his unjust discharge poured from his lips. It flooded the
room like a spilling stream, and none put a word against it,
for they knew he stood a wronged man. Out it came&mdash;all
the rage, all the heart-burning, all the bitterness&mdash;and he
dropped into a chair and covered his face with his hands.
Only the sounder clicking iron jargon and the thunder shaking
the wickiup like a reed filled the ears of the men about
him. They watched him slowly knot his fingers and loosen
them, and saw his face rise dry and hard and old out of his
hands.</p>

<p>"Get up an engine!"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;you're not going down there to-night?" stammered
Bucks.</p>

<p>"Yes. Now. Right off. Peeto, get out your men!"</p>

<p>The foreman jumped for the door. Little Duffy, snatching
the train sheet, began clearing track for a bridge special.
In twenty minutes twenty men were running as many ways
through the storm, and a live engine boomed under the
wickiup window.</p>

<p>"I want you to be careful, Phil," Bucks spoke anxiously
as he looked with Healey out into the storm. "It's a bad
night." Healey made no answer.</p>

<p>The lightning shot the yards in a blaze and a crash split
the gorge. "A wicked night," muttered Bucks.</p>

<p>Evans, conductor of the special, ran in.</p>

<p>"Here's your orders," said Duffy. "You've got forty miles
an hour."</p>

<p>"Don't stretch it," warned Bucks. "Good-by, Phil," he
added to Healey, "I'll see you in the morning."</p>

<p>"In the morning," echoed Healey. "Good-by."</p>

<p>The switch engine had puffed up with a caboose; ahead of
it Peeto had coupled in the pile driver. At the last minute
Callahan concluded to go, and with the bridge gang tumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
into the caboose, the assistant superintendent, Ed Peeto, and
Healey climbed into the engine, and they pulled out, five in
the cab, for the Spider Water.</p>

<p>Healey, moody at first, began joking and laughing the
minute they got away. He sat behind Denis Mullenix, the
engineer, and poked his ribs and taunted him with his heavy
heels. At last he covered Denis' big hands on the throttle
with his own bigger fingers, good-naturedly coaxed them
loose, and pushing him away got the reins and the whip into
his own keeping. He drew the bar out a notch and settled
himself for the run across the flat country.</p>

<p>As they sped from the shelter of the hills, the storm shook
them with a freshening fury, and drove the flanges into the
south rail with a grinding screech. The rain fell in a sheet,
and the right-of-way ran a river. The wind, whipping the
water off the ballast, dashed it like hail against the cab glass;
the segment of desert caught in the yellow of the headlight
rippled and danced and swam in the storm water, and
Healey pulled again at the straining throttle and latched it
wider.</p>

<p>Notch after notch he drew; heedless of lurch and jump;
heedless of bed or curve; heedless of track or storm; and
with every spur at her cylinders the engine shook like a
frantic horse. Men and monster alike lost thought of caution
and drunk a frenzy in the whirl that Healey opened across
the swimming plain.</p>

<p>The Peace River hills loomed suddenly in front like moving
pictures; before they could think it the desert was behind.</p>

<p>"Phil, man, you must steady up!" yelled Callahan, getting
his mouth to Healey's ear. The roadmaster nodded and
checked a notch, but the fire was in his blood, and he slewed
into the hills with a speed unslackened. The wind blew them,
and the track pulled them, and a frenzied man sat at the
throttle.</p>

<p>Just where the line crosses the Peace River the track
bends sharply through the Needles to take the bridge. The
curve is a ten degree. As they struck it, the headlight shot
far out upon the river&mdash;and they in the cab knew they sat
dead men. Instead of lighting the box of the truss, the lamp
lit a black and snaky flood with yellow foam sweeping over
the abutment, for the Peace had licked up Agnew's thirty-foot
piles&mdash;and his bridge was not.</p>

<p>There were two things to do; Healey knew them both,
and both meant death to the cab, but the caboose sheltered
twenty of Healey's faithful men. He instantly threw the
air, and with a scream from the tires, the special, shaking in
the brake shoes, swung the curve. Again the roadmaster
checked heavily, and the pile driver, taking the elevation
like a hurdle, bolted into the Needles, dragging the caboose
after it. But engine and tender and five in the cab plunged
head on into the river.</p>

<p>Not a man in the caboose was killed. They scrambled out
of the splinters and on their feet, men and ready to do. One
voice came through the storm from the river, and they
answered its calling. It was Callahan, but Durden, Mullenix,
Peeto, and Healey never called again.</p>

<p>At daybreak, wreckers of the West End, swarming from
mountain and plain, were heading for the Peace, and the
McCloud gang&mdash;up&mdash;crossed the Spider on Healey's bridge&mdash;on
the bridge the coward trainmen had reported out,
quaking as they did in the storm at the Spider foaming over
its approaches. But Healey's bridge stood&mdash;stands to-day.</p>

<p>Yet three days the Spider raged, and knew then its master,
while he, three whole days, sat at the bottom of the
Peace, clutching the engine levers, in the ruins of Agnew's
mistake.</p>

<p>And when the divers got them up, Callahan and Bucks
tore big Peeto's arms from his master's body and shut his
staring eye and laid him at his master's side. And only the
Spider, ravening at Healey's caissons, raged. But Healey
slept.</p>


<p class="center">THE END.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="GOOD" id="GOOD">GOOD WORDS FOR THE 'GATOR.</a></h2>

<p>Twenty years ago a visitor to that part of the South
below North Carolina could see alligators in almost every
stream and bayou, but now one may frequently spend months
traveling through this region and not see a single alligator
except those in captivity. The killing of the creatures for
sport or for their hides has been the main cause of their
great decrease in numbers. In addition thousands of the
young have been killed or shipped away, while enormous
numbers of the eggs have been gathered and sold as curios.</p>

<p>It was not until about 1855 that the demand for alligator
leather became of importance. The market was not long
continued. In 1869 fashion again called for the leather for
manufacturing into fancy slippers, traveling bags, belts, card
cases, music rolls, etc. The demand has continued to the
present and many thousands of the animals have been
killed, while the preparation of the skins has given employment
to hundreds of people.</p>

<p>The output of the tanneries of this country approximates
275,000 skins annually, worth about $425,000, part of which
come from Mexico and Central America. It is estimated
that about 3,800,000 alligators were killed in Florida alone
between 1880 and 1909, nearly 20,000 being killed in 1908.</p>

<p>The earliest settlers in the Southern States found alligators,
or, as they were then called, crocodiles, exceedingly
abundant in almost all streams, especially in Florida and
Louisiana. Many marvelous tales are found in the early
chronicles of the ravages of these monsters. They were
said to eat dogs and pigs, and to consider the negro an especially
succulent tidbit, while it was considered dangerous to
go into streams where they were known to exist. When such
a stream had to be crossed hours were spent sometimes in
beating it to frighten off the alligators.</p>

<p>The researches of scientists have shown that there is
very slight foundation for such stories, and it is probable
that the greater number of pigs lost by the planters could
have been traced to other enemies, particularly the two-footed
kind, while runaway slaves would naturally encourage
the belief that alligators had dined off them.</p>

<p>The greater part of the supply of alligator leather now
comes from Florida, and owing to excessive hunting the industry
is profitable only in the central part of the peninsula,
in what is called the Lake Okeechobee region and in the
Everglades. Here the principal hunters are Seminole Indians,
who have their homes on hummocks far back in the
Everglades and come to the settlements only when in need
of articles which they cannot produce themselves.</p>

<p>The alligator is most active at night, and his days are
usually spent lying on some low bank or log overhanging the
water, where it can enjoy the warmth of the sun and be able
to retreat to its native element at the first sign of danger.
While on land alligators are very clumsy, in the water they
are exceedingly active, and, being strong swimmers, are able
to catch the larger fish with but slight trouble. For animals
like the muskrat and otter swimming across lagoons they
are always on the watch.</p>

<p>On seizing its prey the alligator sinks with it to the
bottom and there remains until all struggling has ceased; it
is then able with less effort to tear it into pieces. While thus
submerged a peculiar collar at the base of the tongue prevents
the water from passing into its lungs.</p>

<p>While the alligator is said to make very effective use of its
tail in warfare, the widely disseminated story that it uses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
its tail to sweep animals off the banks into its jaws appears
to have but slight foundation in fact.</p>

<p>In April or May the mother alligator seeks a sheltered
spot on a bank and there builds a small mound with a hole
in the middle. The foundation of this mound is of mud
and grass, and on these she lays some eggs. She then covers
the eggs with another stratum of grass and mud, upon which
she deposits some more eggs. Thus she proceeds until she
has laid from twenty-five to sixty eggs. The eggs are
hatched out by the sun.</p>

<p>As soon as they have chipped the shell the baby alligators
are led to the water by the mother, who provides them with
food, which she disgorges. Papa Alligator has to be carefully
watched at this time, for he highly esteems a dinner of
young saurians, and is not particular whether they are his
own or his neighbor's children. When by strategy or downright
fighting the mother has got her family safely into their
natural element it is not long before the young scatter, each
to begin life on his own hook. At this period they form a
favorite food for turtles and the larger fishes.</p>

<p>When fully grown the alligator is about sixteen feet in
length. In the adult stage it is greenish-black above, having
lost the yellowish color bands that belong to its earlier years.
Hunters say that alligators grow very slowly, attaining the
first year a length of about one foot. When two feet in
length they are said to be from ten to fifteen years old,
while those twelve feet long are supposed to be seventy-five
or more. Their normal life is estimated at from one hundred
to one hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>Alligator hunting originally began as sport. Then some
one tanned the skin and found that it could be put to commercial
use. Carried on as it must be, at night, the hunt is
picturesque.</p>

<p>In many places the hunters fasten bicycle lamps on their
caps, and when the animal is attracted by the light pick it
off by hitting it in the eye with a rifle ball. Torches are
often used. Sometimes the hunter lures the alligator to
the surface of the water by "telephoning to the 'gator," as it
is called.</p>

<p>An alligator is always attracted by the peculiar grunt
which the young alligators make, for there is no sort of
food they love better than newly hatched 'gator. The hunter
takes a long, slender pole and lets one end of it down very
quietly into the water. The other end he places between
his teeth and imitates the grunt of the baby 'gators. The
old fellows easily hear the call and come up to feast on
babies they think are there.</p>

<p>In catching them alive hunters frequently lasso them while
asleep on the bank or on a log. When asleep in their holes
in the mud they are occasionally drawn out by means of an
iron hook. These holes are easily found. Sometimes the
grass is set afire and the animals lassoed as they seek the
water.</p>

<p>After the alligator is caught the hunter in sport sometimes
mounts it, using the reptile's fore feet and legs as reins.
It is needless to say that it is only by the exercise of considerable
skill that the hunter keeps his seat through the
struggles of the reptile, and if care is not used the fun may
develop into tragedy.</p>

<p>Alligators three feet and more in length are generally
killed at once and the hide removed. All of the hide except
the ridge of the back, which is very bony, is used. The hide
is salted, and is then in condition for sale to the buyers, who
are usually storekeepers, who furnish provisions and ammunition
in exchange.</p>

<p>The hides range in value to the hunter from 20 cents for
a three-foot hide to $1.25 for a hide seven feet or more in
length. The five and six-foot hides are the most desirable,
as the larger hides have a hard piece of bone in the square
checks on the hide, and it is impossible to sew through this.
Nearly all of the tanning is done at Newark, N. J.</p>

<p>Young alligators are often brought in, and are worth
about 8 cents apiece. The eggs are also gathered, and sell
for 2-1/2 cents each. They are mainly sold to curio dealers,
who either hatch them out or blow them and sell the shells.
Most of the small alligators are stuffed and sold as curios to
tourists, who pay from 50 cents to $2 apiece for them.</p>

<p>Many of them used to be shipped North alive by tourists
as presents. Owing to ignorance as to how the animal
should be cared for many of these soon died.</p>

<p>If properly cared for, the young alligator will thrive even
in unnatural circumstances. Its main requirement is sufficient
heat. Its diet should consist of bits of fresh meat,
insects and worms. They often show great fondness for the
ordinary earthworms, and will frequently refuse all food
but these. The larger specimens in captivity are fed about
three times a week on fresh meat or small live animals, and
they require little attention other than this.</p>

<p>Alligators' teeth, which are secured by burying the head
until they have rotted out, are of fine ivory and valued for
carving into ornaments. They are worth to the hunter about
$2 a pound&mdash;from fifty to seventy-five teeth. The dealers
will not buy very many of them, as there is but a limited
demand. At one time the paws were saved and mounted as
curios, but it is impossible to do anything with them now.</p>

<p>Both flesh and eggs are eaten by a few persons, but it
requires a very hardy stomach to stand the disagreeable,
musky odor. There is nothing better, hunters declare, than
the tip of the tail of an alligator which has reached, say,
the pullet period. It is creamy in color, tasting a little like
frogs' legs, but with a more pronounced gamy flavor, juicy&mdash;altogether
tempting. The dish is a great favorite with the
crackers of Florida.</p>

<p>Alligator tails are best at the time of the ricebird season.
The big alligators float in the water with only their eyes
showing. When an alligator gets near a flock of these fat,
juicy little birds it dives to the bottom. Its long, wide
snout scoops up some of the loam, and it floats to the surface
again with just the rich soil showing.</p>

<p>The birds think it is an island. They alight upon it.
When the whole family is there the big beast turns suddenly.
Just as the birds scramble off the alligator opens its mouth
once. They are gone.</p>

<p>The birds are neat little feeders, and the alligator is an
epicure at this time of the year. The ricebird diet makes
the tip of its tail tender and sweet.</p>

<p>In St. Augustine is an alligator farm, one of two in the
United States, the other being at the Hot Springs in
Arkansas. Here the alligators are kept in confinement until
large enough for market.</p>

<p>It will probably be news to many that Florida has a representative
of the crocodile family. This animal was first
supposed to be confined to the West Indies and South
America, but it has been occasionally captured on the
peninsula of Florida. It is easily distinguishable from the
alligator by its narrow snout. For many years scientists
were skeptical of reports from Florida of the appearance of
this animal in that State, but the capture of several fine
specimens in recent years has settled all doubt.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VENOMOUS" id="VENOMOUS">VENOMOUS FISH.</a></h2>

<p>It is curious that while so much has been written in our
language on snake bites there has been comparatively little
placed on record concerning the stings of fishes.</p>

<p>Snake bites are rare in this country, but fish stings are
very common, especially among fishermen and fishmongers.
The fishes that most often sting are the great and little
weevers. A prick on the hand or foot from a weever
causes much swelling and inflammation.</p>

<p>If the arm is affected the inflammation may spread to the
shoulder, the swelling of the whole limb being enormous.
The pain is agonizing, the patient often falling into a state
of collapse or becoming delirious. Usually the inflammation
subsides in about three days, followed by desquamation.</p>

surprised and delighted. Surprised at the generous quantity of
reading matter that we are giving for five cents; delighted with the
fascinating interest of the stories, second only to those published
in the Tip Top Weekly.</p>

<p>Matt has positive mechanical genius, and while his adventures
are unusual, they are, however, drawn so true to life that the reader can
clearly see how it is possible for the ordinary boy to experience them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
